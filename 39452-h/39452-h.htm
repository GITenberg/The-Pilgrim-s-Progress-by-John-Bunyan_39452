<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>It may seem a very bold undertaking to change
even a word of the book which, next to the
Bible, has been read by more people, old
and young, than any other book in the English
language.</p>

<p>But, it must be remembered that, although the
Pilgrim's Progress has come to be a children's
book, and is read more often by young people
than by those who are older, it was not in the
purpose of John Bunyan to write a book for
children or even for the young.</p>

<p>The Pilgrim's Progress was a book for men and
women; and it was aimed to teach the great
truths of the gospel. Hence while most of it is
written in a simple style,&mdash;as all books should be
written,&mdash;it contains much that a child cannot
understand; not often in the story, but in the
conversations and discussions between the different
persons. Some of these conversations are
in reality short sermons on doctrines and teachings
which Bunyan believed to be of great importance.
But these are beyond the minds of children
and give them great trouble when the book is
read. They do not like to have them left out of
the reading, thinking that they may lose something
interesting. Many a young person has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>stumbled through the dull, doctrinal parts of the
book, without understanding them; and even
grown people find them in our time somewhat of
a blemish upon the wonderful story, valuable as
they were supposed to be in Bunyan's own time.</p>

<p>For many years it has been in my mind, not to
re-write the Pilgrim's Progress, for that would
destroy its greatest charm, but to change the words
here and there to simpler ones, and to omit all
the conversations and arguments concerning subjects
belonging to the field of doctrine; in other
words to place the story of the Pilgrim's Progress
in such a form that every child ten years old can
understand it. My purpose is to make it plain
and interesting to children, leaving the older form
of the book to be read by them when they become
older.</p>

<p>Perhaps a short account of Bunyan's own life
may add to the interest of his book. John Bunyan
was born in 1628 at Elstow, a small village
near Bedford, which is in the heart of England.
His father was a poor man, traveling on foot from
place to place mending pots and pans and the
simple furniture of country kitchens, and the son
followed the same trade, and was known as a
"tinker." He tells us that he lived a wild life,
and was especially known as one of the worst
swearers in the region.</p>

<p>When the great Civil War broke out in England,
in 1642, between King Charles the First and the
Parliament, Bunyan became a soldier on the side
of the Commonwealth, as the party against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
king was called. He served in the army between
1644 and 1646.</p>

<p>In 1648, at the age of twenty years, he married a
good young woman, who led him to prayer and to
a new life. But it was hard for one who had led
such a life as his had been to turn to God, and it
cost the young man a great struggle. It seemed
to him that his past sins were like a load upon his
back, just as he afterward wrote of his "pilgrim,"
and it was long before he found peace.</p>

<p>He became a member of a little Baptist society,
and soon began to preach. Crowds came to hear
him, drawn by his earnest spirit and his quaint
striking manner. But when Charles the Second
became king, no religious services were allowed
except those of the Church of England, and all
other meetings were forbidden. Bunyan however
went on preaching, until he was sent to prison in
Bedford. In Bedford jail he stayed twelve years.
To find a means of living in jail, he made lace,
and sold it as a support for himself and his blind
daughter.</p>

<p>If the prison was hard for Bunyan his sufferings
were made a blessing to untold millions, for while
in Bedford jail he wrote the Pilgrim's Progress.
This story was intended to be a parable, like many
of our Saviour's teachings; that is, it put into the
form of a story the life of one who turns from sin,
finds salvation through Christ, and in the face of
many difficulties makes his way through this
world to heaven. Even a child who reads or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
listens to the book will see this meaning in part;
and he will understand it better as he grows older.</p>

<p>In 1672 Bunyan was set free, and allowed to
begin again his work as a Baptist minister, and
he soon became one of the most popular preachers
in all England. He died quite suddenly in 1688,
when he was sixty years old, and is buried in an
old graveyard now near the center of London,
called Bunhill Fields Burial-ground. In the
same ground is buried another great writer,
Daniel DeFoe, whose story of "Robinson Crusoe"
ranks next to the Pilgrim's Progress in the
number of its readers; also Isaac Watts, the
author of many hymns sung in all the churches,
and Mrs. Susanna Wesley, the mother of the great
John Wesley. Four people who have left a deep
mark upon the world, all lie near together in this
small cemetery in London.</p>

<p>Every child should read the Pilgrim's Progress
as a story if no more than a story; should read it
until he knows it by heart. And the older he
grows the deeper will be the meaning that he will
see in it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p>As I walked through the wilderness of this
world, I lighted on a certain place where
was a den,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and laid me down in that place
to sleep; and as I slept, I dreamed a dream. I
dreamed, and behold, I saw a man clothed with
rags, standing in a certain place, with his face
from his own house, a book in his hand, and a great
burden upon his back. I looked, and saw him
open the book, and read therein; and as he read,
he wept and trembled; and, not being able longer
to contain, he brake out with a lamentable cry,
saying, "What shall I do?"</p>

<p>In this plight, therefore, he went home, and
restrained himself as long as he could, that his
wife and children should not perceive his distress;
but he could not be silent long, because that his
trouble increased. Wherefore at length he brake
his mind to his wife and children; and thus he
began to talk to them: "Oh my dear wife," said
he, "and you my sweet children, I, your dear
friend, am in myself undone by reason of a burden
that lieth hard upon me; moreover, I am told to
a certainty that this our city will be burned with
fire from heaven; in which fearful overthrow, both
myself, with thee, my wife, and you, my sweet
babes, shall miserably come to ruin, except some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
way of escape can be found whereby we may be
delivered." At this all his family were sore
amazed; not for that they believed that what he
had said to them was true, but because they
thought that some frenzy or madness had got into
his head; therefore, it drawing towards night,
and they hoping that sleep might settle his brain,
with all haste they got him to bed. But the
night was as troublesome to him as the day;
wherefore, instead of sleeping, he spent it in sighs
and tears. So when the morning was come, they
would know how he did. He told them, Worse
and worse: he also set to talking to them again;
but they began to be hardened. They also
thought to drive away his madness by harsh and
surly treatment of him: sometimes they would
ridicule, sometimes they would chide, and sometimes
they would quite neglect him. Wherefore
he began to retire himself to his chamber, to pray
for and pity them, and also to sorrow over his own
misery; he would also walk solitary in the fields,
sometimes reading, and sometimes praying; and
thus for some days he spent his time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTIAN'S DISTRESS OF MIND</div>

<p>Now, I saw, upon a time, when he was walking
in the fields, that he was (as he was wont) reading
in his book, and greatly distressed in his mind;
and as he read, he burst out as he had done before,
crying, "What shall I do to be saved?"</p>

<p>I saw also that he looked this way and that way,
as if he would run; yet he stood still, because
(as I perceived) he could not tell which way to go. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>I looked then, and saw a man named Evangelist
coming to him, who asked, "Wherefore dost thou
cry?"</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_020.jpg" width="400" height="608" alt="Evangelist Points to Wicket-Gate." title="Evangelist Points to Wicket-Gate.

<span class="caption">Evangelist Points to Wicket-Gate.<br />

</span>
</div>


<p>He answered, "Sir, I read in the book in my
hand, that I am condemned to die, and after that
to come to judgment; and I find that I am not
willing to do the first, nor able to do the second."</p>

<p>Then said Evangelist, "Why not willing to die,
since this life is troubled with so many evils?"
The man answered, "Because I fear that this
burden that is upon my back will sink me lower
than the grave, and I shall fall into Tophet.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
And, sir, if I be not fit to go to prison, I am not fit
to go to judgment, and from thence to death; and
the thoughts of these things make me cry."</p>

<p>Then said Evangelist, "If this be thy condition,
why standest thou still?"</p>

<p>He answered, "Because I know not whither to
go." Then he gave him a parchment roll, and
there was written within, "Flee from the wrath
to come."</p>

<p>The man, therefore, read it, and looking upon
Evangelist very carefully, said, "Whither must
I fly?" Then said Evangelist (pointing with his
finger over a very wide field), "Do you see yonder
wicket-gate?" The man said, "No." Then said
the other, "Do you see yonder shining light?"
He said, "I think I do." Then said Evangelist,
"Keep that light in your eye, and go up directly
thereto; so shalt thou see the gate; at which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
when thou knockest, it shall be told thee what
thou shalt do." So I saw in my dream that the
man began to run. Now, he had not run far from
his own door, when his wife and children perceiving
it, began to cry after him to return; but the
man put his fingers in his ears, and ran on, crying,
"Life! life! eternal life!" So he looked not behind
him, but fled towards the middle of the plain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTIAN FLEES FROM THE CITY</div>

<p>The neighbors also came out to see him run;
and as he ran, some mocked, others threatened,
and some cried after him to return; and among
those that did so there were two that resolved to
fetch him back by force. The name of the one
was Obstinate, and the name of the other Pliable.
Now, by this time the man was got a good distance
from them; but, however, they were
resolved to pursue him, which they did, and in a
little time they overtook him. Then said the
man, "Neighbors, wherefore are ye come?"
They said, "To persuade you to go back with us."
But he said, "That can by no means be: you
dwell," said he, "in the City of Destruction, the
place also where I was born: I see it to be so;
and, dying there, sooner or later, you will sink
lower than the grave, into a place that burns with
fire and brimstone. Be content, good neighbors,
and go along with me."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Obst.</span> "What!" said Obstinate, "and leave our
friends and comforts behind us?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "Yes," said Christian (for that was his
name), "because that all which you forsake is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
worthy to be compared with a little of that I am
seeking to enjoy; and if you would go along with
me, and hold it, you shall fare as I myself; for
there, where I go, is enough and to spare. Come
away, and prove my words."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Obst.</span> What are the things you seek, since you
leave all the world to find them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I seek a place that can never be destroyed,
one that is pure, and that fadeth not
away, and it is laid up in heaven, and safe there,
to be given, at the time appointed, to them that
seek it with all their heart. Read it so, if you will,
in my book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Obst.</span> "Tush!" said Obstinate, "away with
your book; will you go back with us or no?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "No, not I," said the other, "because
I have put my hand to the plough."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Obst.</span> Come, then, neighbor Pliable, let us turn
again, and go home without him: there is a company
of these crazy-headed fools, that, when they
take a fancy by the end, are wiser in their own
eyes than seven men that can render a reason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pli.</span> Then said Pliable, "Don't revile; if what
the good Christian says is true, the things he looks
after are better than ours; my heart inclines to go
with my neighbor."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Obst.</span> What! more fools still? Be ruled by me,
and go back; who knows whither such a brain-sick
fellow will lead you? Go back, go back, and
be wise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Nay, but do thou come with thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
neighbor Pliable; there are such things to be had
which I spoke of, and many more glories besides.
If you believe not me, read here in this book; and
for the truth of what is told therein, behold, all is
made by the blood of Him that made it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pli.</span> "Well, neighbor Obstinate," said Pliable,
"I begin to come to a point; I intend to go along
with this good man, and to cast in my lot with
him. But, my good companion, do you know the
way to this desired place?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I am directed by a man, whose name is
Evangelist, to speed me to a little gate that is
before us, where we shall receive directions about
the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pli.</span> Come, then, good neighbor, let us be
going. Then they went both together.</p>

<p>"And I will go back to my place," said Obstinate;
"I will be no companion of such misled,
fantastical fellows."</p>

<p>Now, I saw in my dream, that, when Obstinate
was gone back, Christian and Pliable went talking
over the plain; and thus they began:</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISCOURSES WITH PLIABLE</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Come, neighbor Pliable, how do you do?
I am glad you are persuaded to go along with me.
Had even Obstinate himself but felt what I have
felt of the powers and terrors of what is yet unseen,
he would not thus lightly have given us the back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pli.</span> Come, neighbor Christian, since there are
none but us two here, tell me now further what
the things are, and how to be enjoyed, whither we
are going.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I can better understand them with my
mind than speak of them with my tongue; but
yet, since you are desirous to know, I will read of
them in my book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pli.</span> And do you think that the words of your
book are certainly true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Yes, verily; for it was made by Him
that cannot lie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pli.</span> Well said; what things are they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> There is an endless kingdom to be
enjoyed, and everlasting life to be given us, that
we may live in that kingdom forever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pli.</span> Well said; and what else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> There are crowns of glory to be given us,
and garments that will make us shine like the sun
in the sky.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pli.</span> This is very pleasant; and what else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> There shall be no more crying, nor
sorrow; for he that is owner of the place will wipe
all tears from our eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pli.</span> And what company shall we have there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> There we shall be with seraphims and
cherubims, creatures that shall dazzle your eyes
to look on them. There also you shall meet with
thousands and ten thousands that have gone
before us to that place; none of them are hurtful,
but all loving and holy; every one walking in the
sight of God, and standing in His presence with
acceptance for ever. In a word, there we shall
see the elders with their golden crowns; there we
shall see the holy women with their golden harps;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
there we shall see men that by the world were cut
in pieces, burnt in flames, eaten of beasts, drowned
in the seas, for the love they bear to the Lord of
the place, all well, and clothed with everlasting
life as with a garment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pli.</span> The hearing of this is enough to delight
one's heart. But are these things to be enjoyed?
How shall we get to be sharers thereof?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> The Lord, the Governor of the country,
hath written that in this book; the substance of
which is, If we be truly willing to have it, He will
bestow it upon us freely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pli.</span> Well, my good companion, glad am I to
hear of these things; come on, let us mend our
pace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I cannot go so fast as I would, by reason
of this burden that is on my back.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SLOUGH OF DESPOND</div>

<p>Now, I saw in my dream, that just as they had
ended this talk, they drew nigh to a very miry
slough or swamp, that was in the midst of the
plain; and they, being heedless, did both fall
suddenly into the bog. The name of the slough
was Despond. Here, therefore, they wallowed
for a time, being grievously bedaubed with the
dirt; and Christian, because of the burden that
was on his back, began to sink into the mire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pli.</span> Then said Pliable, "Ah! neighbor Christian
where are you now?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "Truly," said Christian, "I do not
know."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pli.</span> At this Pliable began to be offended, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
angrily said to his fellow, "Is this the happiness
you have told me all this while of? If we have
such ill speed at our first setting out, what may we
expect between this and our journey's end? May
I get out again with my life, you shall possess the
brave country alone for me." And with that, he
gave a desperate struggle or two, and got out of
the mire on that side of the swamp which was next
to his own house: so away he went, and Christian
saw him no more.</p>

<p>Wherefore Christian was left to tumble in the
Slough of Despond alone; but still he tried to
struggle to that side of the slough which was
farthest from his own house, and next to the
wicket-gate; the which, he did but could not get
out because of the burden that was upon his back;
but I beheld in my dream, that a man came to
him whose name was Help, and asked him, What
he did there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "Sir," said Christian, "I was bid to go
this way by a man called Evangelist, who directed
me also to yonder gate, that I might escape the
wrath to come; and as I was going there I fell in
here."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Help.</span> But why did you not look for the steps?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Fear followed me so hard, that I fled
the next way and fell in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Help.</span> Then said he, "Give me thine hand."
So he gave him his hand, and he drew him out,
and set him upon solid ground, and bade him go
on his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>Then I stepped to him that plucked him out,
and said, "Sir, wherefore, since over this place is
the way from the City of Destruction to yonder
gate, is it that this place is not mended, that poor
travelers might go thither with more safety?"
And he said unto me, "This miry slough is such a
place as cannot be mended; it is the hollow
whither the scum and filth that go with the feeling
of sin, do continually run, and therefore it
is called the Slough of Despond; for still, as the
sinner is awakened by his lost condition, there
arise in his soul many fears, and doubts, and discouraging
alarms, which all of them get together
and settle in this place; and this is the reason of
the badness of the ground.</p>

<p>"It is not the pleasure of the King that this
place should remain so bad. His laborers also
have, by the direction of His Majesty's surveyors,
been for about these sixteen hundred years
employed about this patch of ground, if perhaps
it might have been mended; yea, and to my
knowledge," said he, "here have been swallowed
up at least twenty thousand cart-loads, yea,
millions, of wholesome teachings, that have at all
seasons been brought from all places of the King's
dominions (and they that can tell say they are the
best materials to make good ground of the place),
if so be it might have been mended; but it is the
Slough of Despond still, and so will be when they
have done what they can.</p>

<p>"True, there are, by the direction of the Lawgiver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
certain good and substantial steps, placed
even through the very midst of this slough; but
at such time as this place doth much spew out its
filth, as it doth against change of weather, these
steps are hardly seen; or, if they be, men, through
the dizziness of their heads, step aside, and then
they are bemired to purpose, notwithstanding the
steps be there; but the ground is good when they
are got in at the gate."</p>

<p>Now, I saw in my dream, that by this time
Pliable was got home to his house. So his
neighbors came to visit him; and some of them
called him wise man for coming back, and some
called him a fool for risking himself with Christian;
others again did mock at his cowardliness, saying
"Surely since you began to venture, I would not
have been so base to have given out for a few
difficulties;" so Pliable sat sneaking among them.
But at last he got more confidence; and then they
all turned their tales, and began to abuse poor
Christian behind his back. And thus much concerning
Pliable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WORLDLY WISEMAN'S COUNSEL</div>

<p>Now, as Christian was walking solitary by himself,
he espied one afar off come crossing over the
field to meet him; and their hap was to meet just
as they were crossing the way of each other. The
gentleman's name that met him was Mr. Worldly
Wiseman: he dwelt in the town of Carnal Policy,
a very great town, and also hard by from whence
Christian came. This man, then, meeting with
Christian, and having heard about him&mdash;(for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Christian's setting forth from the City of Destruction
was much noised abroad, not only in the town
where he dwelt, but also it began to be the town-talk
in some other places)&mdash;Mr. Worldly Wiseman
therefore, having some guess of him, by beholding
his laborious going, by noticing his sighs and
groans, and the like, began thus to enter into
some talk with Christian:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">World.</span> How now, good fellow! whither away
after this burdened manner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> A burdened manner indeed, as ever I
think poor creature had! And whereas you ask
me, Whither away? I tell you, sir, I am going to
yonder wicket-gate before me; for there, as I am
informed, I shall be put into a way to be rid of my
heavy burden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">World.</span> Hast thou a wife and children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Yes; but I am so laden with this
burden, that I cannot take that pleasure in them
as formerly; methinks I am as if I had none.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">World.</span> Wilt thou hearken to me, if I give
thee counsel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> If it be <i>good</i>, I will; for I stand in need
of good counsel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">World.</span> I would advise thee, then, that thou
with all speed get thyself rid of thy burden; for
thou wilt never be settled in thy mind till then;
nor canst thou enjoy the blessings which God hath
bestowed upon thee till then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> That is that which I seek for, even to be
rid of this heavy burden; but get it off myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
I cannot; nor is there any man in our country
that can take it off my shoulders; therefore am I
going this way, as I told you, that I may be rid of
my burden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">World.</span> Who bid thee go this way to be rid of
thy burden?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> A man that appeared to me to be a very
great and honorable person; his name, as I remember,
is Evangelist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">World.</span> I curse him for his counsel! there is
not a more dangerous and troublesome way in the
world than is that into which he hath directed
thee; and that thou shalt find, if thou wilt be
ruled by his advice. Thou hast met with something,
as I perceive, already; for I see the dirt of
the Slough of Despond is upon thee; but that
slough is the beginning of the sorrows that do
attend those that go on in that way. Hear me:
I am older than thou: thou art like to meet with,
in the way which thou goest, wearisomeness, painfulness,
hunger, perils, nakedness, sword, lions,
dragons, darkness, and, in a word, death, and
what not. These things are certainly true, having
been proved by the words of many people. And
why should a man so carelessly cast away himself,
by giving heed to a stranger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Why, sir, this burden upon my back is
more terrible to me than all these things which
you have mentioned; nay, methinks I care not
what I meet with in the way, if so be I can also
meet with deliverance from my burden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span><span class="smcap">World.</span> How camest thou by the burden at
first?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> By reading this book in my hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">World.</span> I thought so. And it has happened
unto thee as unto other weak men, who, meddling
with things too high for them, do suddenly fall
into thy crazy thoughts, which thoughts do not
only unman men, as thine I perceive have done
thee, but they run them upon desperate efforts to
obtain they know not what.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I know what I would obtain; it is ease
for my heavy burden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">World.</span> But why wilt thou seek for ease this
way, seeing so many dangers attend it? Especially
since (hadst thou but patience to hear me,) I
could direct thee to the getting of what thou
desirest, without the dangers that thou in this way
wilt run thyself into. Yea, and the remedy is at
hand. Besides, I will add that, instead of those
dangers, thou shalt meet with much safety, friendship,
and content.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Sir, I pray, open this secret to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">World.</span> Why, in yonder village (the village is
named Morality), there dwells a gentleman whose
name is Legality, a very wise man, and a man of
very good name, that has skill to help men off with
such burdens as thine is from their shoulders; yea,
to my knowledge he hath done a great deal of
good this way; aye, and besides, he hath skill to
cure those that are somewhat crazed in their wits
with their burdens. To him, as I said, thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
mayest go, and be helped presently. His house is
not quite a mile from this place; and if he should
not be at home himself, he hath a pretty young
man as his son, whose name is Civility, that can
do it (to speak on) as well as the old gentleman
himself. There, I say, thou mayest be eased of
thy burden; and if thou art not minded to go back
to thy former habitation (as indeed I would not
wish thee), thou mayest send for thy wife and
children to thee in this village, where there are
houses now standing empty, one of which thou
mayest have at a reasonable rate; provision is
there also cheap and good; and that which will
make thy life the more happy is, to be sure there
thou shalt live by honest neighbors, in credit and
good fashion.</p>

<p>Now was Christian somewhat at a stand; but
presently he concluded, "If this be true which this
gentleman hath said, my wisest course is to take
his advice;" and with that, he thus further spake:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Sir, which is my way to this honest
man's house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">World.</span> Do you see yonder high hill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Yes, very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">World.</span> By that hill you must go, and the first
house you come at is his.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EVANGELIST AND CHRISTIAN.</div>

<p>So Christian turned out of his way to go to Mr.
Legality's house for help; but, behold, when he
was got now hard by the hill, it seemed so high,
and also that side of it that was next the wayside
did hang so much over, that Christian was afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to venture farther, lest the hill should fall on his
head; wherefore there he stood still, and knew not
what to do. Also his burden now seemed heavier
to him than while he was in his way. There came
also flashes of fire out of the hill, that made
Christian afraid that he should be burnt: here,
therefore, he sweat and did quake for fear. And
now he began to be sorry that he had taken Mr.
Worldly Wiseman's counsel; and with that, he
saw Evangelist coming to meet him, at the sight
also of whom he began to blush for shame. So
Evangelist drew nearer and nearer; and, coming
up to him, he looked upon him with a severe and
dreadful countenance, and thus began to reason
with Christian:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evan.</span> "What dost thou here, Christian?" said
he; at which words Christian knew not what to
answer; wherefore at present he stood speechless
before him. Then said Evangelist further, "Art
thou not the man that I found crying, without
the walls of the City of Destruction?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Yes, dear sir, I am the man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evan.</span> Did not I direct thee the way to the
little wicket-gate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "Yes, dear sir," said Christian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evan.</span> How is it, then, that thou art so quickly
turned aside? For thou art now out of the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I met with a gentleman as soon as I had
got over the Slough of Despond, who persuaded
me that I might, in the village before me, find a
man that could take off my burden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>Evan.</span> What was he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> He looked like a gentleman, and talked
much to me, and got me at last to yield: so I came
hither, but when I beheld this hill, and how it
hangs over the way, I suddenly made a stand, lest
it should fall on my head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evan.</span> What said that gentleman to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Why, he asked me whither I was going,
and I told him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evan.</span> And what said he then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> He asked me if I had a family, and I
told him. But, said I, I am so laden with the
burden that is on my back, that I cannot take
pleasure in them as formerly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evan.</span> And what said he then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> He bid me with speed get rid of my
burden; and I told him it was ease that I sought.
And, said I, I am therefore going to yonder gate
to receive further direction how I may get to the
place of deliverance. So he said that he would
show me a better way, and short, not so hard as
the way, sir, that you sent me in; which way, said
he, will direct you to a gentleman's house that
hath skill to take off these burdens. So I believed
him, and turned out of that way into this, if haply
I might soon be eased of my burden. But, when
I came to this place, and beheld things as they are,
I stopped for fear (as I said) of danger; but I now
know not what to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evan.</span> Then said Evangelist, "Stand still a
little, that I may show thee the words of God."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
So he stood trembling. Then said Evangelist,
"God says in his book, 'See that ye refuse not him
that speaketh; for if they escaped not who refused
him that spake on earth, much more shall not we
escape, if we turn away from Him that speaketh
from heaven.' He said, moreover, 'Now, the
righteous man shall live by faith in God, but if any
man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in
him.'" He also did thus apply them: "Thou art
the man that art running into misery; thou hast
begun to reject the counsel of the Most High, and
to draw back thy foot from the way of peace, even
almost to the danger of thy everlasting ruin."</p>

<p>Then Christian fell down at his feet as dead,
crying, "Woe is me, for I am undone!" At the
sight of which Evangelist caught him by the right
hand, saying, "All manner of sin and evil words
shall be forgiven unto men." "Be not faithless,
but believing." Then did Christian again a little
revive, and stood up trembling, as at first, before
Evangelist.</p>

<p>Then Evangelist proceeded, saying, "Give more
earnest heed to the things that I shall tell thee of.
I will now show thee who it was that led thee
astray, and who it was also to whom he sent thee.
That man that met thee is one Worldly Wiseman;
and rightly is he so called; partly because he seeks
only for the things of this world (therefore he
always goes to the town of Morality to church),
and partly because he loveth that way best, for it
saveth him from the Cross; and because he is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
this evil temper, therefore he seeketh to turn you
from my way though it is the right way.</p>

<p>"He to whom thou wast sent for ease, being by
name Legality, is not able to set thee free from
thy burden. No man was as yet ever rid of his
burden by him; no, nor ever is like to be: ye
cannot be set right by any such plan. Therefore,
Mr. Worldly Wiseman is an enemy, and Mr.
Legality is a cheat; and, for his son Civility, notwithstanding
his simpering looks, he is but a fraud
and cannot help thee. Believe me, there is
nothing in all this noise that thou hast heard of
these wicked men, but a design to rob thee of thy
salvation, by turning thee from the way in which
I had set thee." After this, Evangelist called
aloud to the heavens for proof of what he had said;
and with that there came words and fire out of the
mountain under which poor Christian stood, which
made the hair of his flesh stand up. The words
were thus spoken: "As many as are of the works
of the law are under the curse."</p>

<p>Now, Christian looked for nothing but death,
and began to cry out lamentably; even cursing
the time in which he met with Mr. Worldly Wiseman;
still calling himself a thousand fools for
listening to his counsel. He also was greatly
ashamed to think that this gentleman's arguments
should have the power with him so far as to cause
him to forsake the right way. This done, he
spoke again to Evangelist, in words and sense
as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chris</span>. Sir, what think you? Is there any
hope? May I now go back, and go up to the
wicket-gate? Shall I not be abandoned for this,
and sent back from thence ashamed? I am sorry
I have hearkened to this man's counsel; but may
my sins be forgiven?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evan.</span> Then said Evangelist to him, "Thy sin
is very great, for by it thou hast committed two
evils; thou hast forsaken the way that is good, to
tread in forbidden paths. Yet will the man at
the gate receive thee, for he has good will for men;
only," said he, "take heed that thou turn not
aside again, lest thou perish from the way, when
his anger is kindled but a little."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>Then did Christian begin to go back to the
right road; and Evangelist, after he had
kissed him, gave him one smile, and bid him
God speed; so he went on with haste, neither
spake he to any man by the way; nor, if any asked
him, would he give them an answer. He went
like one that was all the while treading on forbidden
ground, and could by no means think himself
safe, till again he was got in the way which
he had left to follow Mr. Worldly Wiseman's
counsel: so after a time, Christian got up to the
gate. Now, over the gate there was written,
"Knock, and it shall be opened unto you."</p>

<p>He knocked, therefore, more than once or twice,
saying:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"May I now enter here? Will He within</span><br />
<span class="i0">Open to sorry me, though I have been</span><br />
<span class="i0">An undeserving rebel? Then shall I</span><br />
<span class="i0">Not fail to sing His lasting praise on high."</span>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">GOODWILL OPENS THE GATE</div>

<p>At last there came a grave person to the gate
named Goodwill, who asked who was there, and
whence he came, and what he would have?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Here is a poor burdened sinner. I come
from the City of Destruction, but am going to
Mount Zion, that I may be set free from the wrath
to come; I would therefore, sir, since I am told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
that by this gate is the way thither, know, if you
are willing to let me in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Good.</span> "I am willing with all my heart," said
he; and, with that, he opened the gate.</p>

<p>So, when Christian was stepping in, the other
gave him a pull. Then said Christian, "What
means that?" The other told him, "A little distance
from this gate there is erected a strong
castle, of which Beelzebub, the Evil One, is the
captain; from whence both he and they that are
with him shoot arrows at those that come up to
this gate, if haply they may die before they can
enter in." Then said Christian, "I rejoice and
tremble." So when he was got in, the man of the
gate asked him who directed him thither.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Evangelist bid me come hither and
knock, as I did; and he said that you, sir, would
tell me what I must do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Good.</span> An open door is set before thee, and no
man can shut it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Now I begin to reap the benefit of the
trouble which I have taken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Good.</span> But how is it that you came alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Because none of my neighbors saw their
danger, as I saw mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Good.</span> Did any of them know you were coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Yes, my wife and children saw me at
the first, and called after me to turn again; also
some of my neighbors stood crying and calling
after me to return; but I put my fingers in my
ears, and so came on my way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span><span class="smcap">Good.</span> But did none of them follow you, to
persuade you to go back?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Yes, both Obstinate and Pliable: but,
when they saw that they could not prevail,
Obstinate went railing back, but Pliable came
with me a little way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Good.</span> But why did he not come through?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> We indeed came both together until we
came to the Slough of Despond, into the which we
also suddenly fell. And then was my neighbor
Pliable discouraged, and would not venture
farther. Wherefore, getting out again on the side
next his own house, he told me I should win the
brave country alone for him: so he went his way,
and I came mine; he after Obstinate, and I to
this gate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Good.</span> Then said Goodwill, "Alas, poor man!
is the heavenly glory of so little worth with him,
that he counteth it not worth running the risk of a
few difficulties to obtain it?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "Truly," said Christian, "I have said
the truth of Pliable; and if I should also say the
truth of myself, it will appear there is not betterment
betwixt him and myself. 'Tis true, he went
on back to his own house; but I also turned aside
to go into the way of death, being persuaded
thereto by the words of one Mr. Worldly Wiseman."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Good.</span> Oh! did he light upon you? What! he
would have had you seek for ease at the hands of
Mr. Legality! They are both of them a very
cheat. But did you take his counsel?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Yes, as far as I durst. I went to find
out Mr. Legality, until I thought that the mountain
that stands by his house would have fallen
upon my head: wherefore there I was forced to
stop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Good.</span> That mountain has been the death of
many, and will be the death of many more; it is
well you escaped being by it dashed in pieces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Why, truly, I do not know what had
become of me there, had not Evangelist happily
met me again as I was musing in the midst of my
dumps; but it was God's mercy that he came to
me again, for else I had never come hither. But
now I am come, such a one as I am, more fit indeed
for death by that mountain, than thus to stand
talking with my Lord. But, oh! what a favor
this is to me, that yet I am to enter here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Good.</span> We make no objections against any,
notwithstanding all that they have done before
they come hither; they in no wise are cast out.
And therefore, good Christian, come a little with
me, and I will teach thee about the way thou must
go. Look before thee: dost thou see this narrow
way? That is the way thou must go. It was
cast up by the men of old, prophets, Christ and
His apostles, and it is as straight as a rule can
make it: this is the way thou must go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "But," said Christian, "are there no
turnings nor windings by which a stranger may
lose his way?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Good.</span> "Yes, there are many ways butt down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
upon this, and they are crooked and wide; but
thus thou mayest distinguish the right from the
wrong, the right only being straight and narrow."</p>

<p>Then I saw in my dream, that Christian asked
him further if he could not help him off with his
burden that was upon his back. For as yet he
had not got rid thereof, nor could he by any means
get it off without help.</p>

<p>He told him, "As to thy burden, be content to
bear it until thou comest to the place of deliverance;
for there it will fall from thy back of itself."</p>

<p>Then Christian began to gird up his loins, and
to turn again to his journey.</p>

<p>So the other told him that as soon as he was
gone some distance from the gate, he would come
at the house of the Interpreter, at whose door he
should knock, and he would show him excellent
things. Then Christian took his leave of his
friend, and he again bid him God speed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">House of the Interpreter</div>

<p>Then he went on till he came to the house of the
Interpreter, where he knocked over and over.
At last one came to the door, and asked who was
there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Sir, here is a traveler who was bid by
a friend of the good man of this house to call here
for his benefit; I would therefore speak with the
master of the house.</p>

<p>So he called for the master of the house, who,
after a little time, came to Christian, and asked
him what he would have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "Sir," said Christian, "I am a man that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
am come from the City of Destruction, and am
going to Mount Zion; and I was told by the man
that stands at the gate at the head of this way,
that, if I called here, you would show me excellent
things, such as would be helpful to me on my
journey."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> Then said the Interpreter, "Come in;
I will show thee that which will be profitable to
thee." So he commanded his man to light the
candle, and bid Christian follow him; so he led
him into a private room, and bid his man open a
door; the which when he had done, Christian saw
the picture of a very grave person hung up against
the wall; and this was the fashion of it: it had
eyes lifted up to heaven, the best of books in its
hand, the law of truth was written upon its lips,
the world was behind its back; it stood as if it
pleaded with men, and a crown of gold did hang
over its head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then said Christian, "What meaneth
this?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> The man whose picture this is, is one of
a thousand. He can say, in the words of the
apostle Paul, "Though ye have ten thousand
teachers in Christ, yet have you not many fathers;
for in Christ Jesus I have been your father through
the Gospel." And whereas thou seest him with
his eyes lifted up to heaven, the best of books in
his hand, and the law of truth writ on his lips, it is
to show thee that his work is to know and unfold
dark things to sinners; even as also thou seest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
him stand as if he pleaded with men. And
whereas thou seest the world is cast behind him,
and that a crown hangs over his head; that is to
show thee that, slighting and despising the things
that are in the world, for the love that he hath to
his Master's service, he is sure in the world that
comes next to have glory for his reward. Now,
said the Interpreter, I have showed thee this
picture first, because the man whose picture this
is, is the only man whom the Lord of the place
whither thou art going hath chosen to be thy
guide, in all difficult places thou mayest meet with
in thy way; wherefore take good heed to what
I have showed thee, and bear well in thy mind
what thou hast seen, lest in thy journey thou meet
with some that pretend to lead thee right, but
their way goes down to death.</p>

<p>Then he took him by the hand, and led him into
a very large parlor, that was full of dust, because
never swept; the which after he had looked at it
a little while, the Interpreter called for a man to
sweep. Now, when he began to sweep, the dust
began so abundantly to fly about that Christian
had almost therewith been choked. Then said
the Interpreter to a girl that stood by, "Bring
hither water, and sprinkle the room;" the which
when she had done, it was swept and cleansed
with ease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then said Christian, "What means
this?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> The Interpreter answered, "This parlor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
is the heart of a man that was never made pure by
the sweet grace of the Gospel. The dust is his sin,
and inward evils that have defiled the whole man.
He that began to sweep at first is the law; but
she that brought water, and did sprinkle it, is the
Gospel. Now, whereas thou sawest that, as soon
as the first began to sweep, the dust did fly so
about that the room could not by him be cleansed,
but that thou wast almost choked therewith;
this is to show thee, that the law, instead of
cleansing the heart (by its working) from sin, doth
revive, put strength into, and increase it in the
soul, even as it doth discover and forbid it, for it
doth not give power to overcome. Again, as thou
sawest the girl sprinkle the room with water, upon
which it was cleansed with ease; this is to show
thee, that when the Gospel comes, in the sweet
and gracious power thereof, to the heart, then, I
say, even as thou sawest the maiden lay the dust
by sprinkling the floor with water, so is sin vanquished
and subdued, and the soul made clean
through the faith of it, and, consequently, fit for
the King of Glory to dwell in."</p>

<p>I saw moreover in my dream, that the Interpreter
took him by the hand, and led him into a
little room where sat two little children, each one
in his own chair. The name of the eldest was
Passion, and the name of the other Patience.
Passion seemed to be much discontented, but
Patience was very quiet. The Christian asked,
"What is the reason of the discontent of Passion?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
The Interpreter answered, "The governor of them
would have him stay for his best things till the
beginning of next year; but he will have all now.
Patience is willing to wait."</p>

<p>Then I saw that one came to Passion, and
brought him a bag of treasure, and poured it down
at his feet; the which he took up, and rejoiced
therein, and withal laughed Patience to scorn.
But I beheld but awhile, and he had wasted all
away, and had nothing left him but rags.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then said Christian to the Interpreter,
"Explain this matter more fully to me."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> So he said, "These two lads are pictures:
Passion, of the men of this world; and Patience,
of the men of that which is to come: for, as here
thou seest, Passion will have all now, this year,
that is to say in this world; so are the men of this
world; they must have all their good things now;
they cannot stay till the next year, that is, until
the next world, for their portion of good. That
proverb, 'A bird in the hand is worth two in the
bush,' is of more weight with them than all the
words in the Bible of the good of the world to
come. But, as thou sawest that he had quickly
wasted all away, and had presently left him
nothing but rags, so will it be with all such men at
the end of this world."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then said Christian, "Now I see that
Patience has the best wisdom, and that upon
many accounts. 1. Because he stays for the best
things. 2. And also because he will have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
glory of his when the other has nothing but rags."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> Nay, you may add another; this, the
glory of the next world will never wear out; but
these are suddenly gone. Therefore Passion had
not so much reason to laugh at Patience because
he had his good things at first, as Patience will
have to laugh at Passion, because he had his best
things last; for first must give place to last,
because last must have his time to come; but last
gives place to nothing, for there is not another to
succeed: he, therefore, that hath his portion first,
must needs have a time to spend it; but he that
hath his portion last, must have it lastingly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then I see it is not best to covet things
that are now, but to wait for things to come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> You say truth; "for the things that are
seen soon pass away, but the things that are not
seen endure forever."</p>

<p>Then I saw in my dream, that the Interpreter
took Christian by the hand and led him into a
place where was a fire burning against a wall, and
one standing by it, always casting much water
upon it, to quench it; yet did the fire burn higher
and hotter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then said Christian, "What means
this?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> The Interpreter answered, "This fire is
the work of God that is wrought in the heart: he
that casts water upon it to extinguish and put it
out, is the devil; but, in that thou seest the fire
notwithstanding burn higher and hotter, thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
shalt also see the reason of that." So then he led
him about to the other side of the wall, where he
saw a man with a vessel of oil in his hand, of the
which he did also continually cast, but secretly,
into the fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then said Christian, "What means
this?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> The Interpreter answered, "This is
Christ, who continually, with the oil of His grace,
helps the work already begun in the heart; by the
means of which notwithstanding what the devil
can do, the souls of His people prove gracious still.
And in that thou sawest that the man stood
behind the wall to keep up the fire; this is to
teach thee, that it is hard for the tempted to see
how this work of grace is kept alive in the soul."</p>

<p>I saw also that the Interpreter took him again
by the hand, and led him into a pleasant place,
where was built a stately palace, beautiful to
behold, at the sight of which Christian was greatly
delighted. He saw also upon the top thereof
certain persons walking, who were clothed all in gold.</p>

<p>Then said Christian, "May we go in thither?"</p>

<p>Then the Interpreter took him and led him up
toward the door of the palace; and behold, at the
door stood a great company of men, as desirous
to go in, but durst not. There also sat a man at
a little distance from the door, at a table-side, with
a book and his ink-horn before him, to take the
name of him that should enter therein; he saw
also that in the doorway stood many men in armor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to keep it, being resolved to do to the men that
would enter what hurt and mischief they could.
Now was Christian somewhat in amaze. At last,
when every man started back for fear of the
armed men, Christian saw a man of a very stout
countenance come up to the man that sat there
to write, saying, "Set down my name, sir:" the
which when he had done, he saw the man draw
his sword, and put a helmet upon his head, and
rush toward the door upon the armed men, who
laid upon him with deadly force; but the man,
not at all discouraged, fell to cutting and hacking
most fiercely. So that, after he had received and
given many wounds to those that attempted to
keep him out, he cut his way through them all and
pressed forward into the palace; at which there
was a pleasant voice heard from those that were
within, even of those that walked upon the top of
the palace, saying:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Come in, come in;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Eternal glory thou shalt win."</span><br />
</div>

<p>So he went in, and was clothed in such garments
as they. Then Christian smiled, and said, "I
think verily I know the meaning of this."</p>

<p>"Now," said Christian, "let me go hence."
"Nay, stay," said the Interpreter, "until I have
showed thee a little more; and after that thou
shalt go on thy way." So he took him by the
hand again, and led him into a very dark room,
where there sat a man in an iron cage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>Now, the man, to look on, seemed very sad.
He sat with his eyes looking down to the ground,
his hands folded together; and he sighed as if he
would break his heart. Then said Christian,
"What means this?" At which the Interpreter
bid him talk with the man.</p>

<p>Then said Christian to the man, "What art
thou?" The man answered, "I am what I was
not once."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> What wast thou once?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man.</span> The man said, "I was once a fair and
flourishing Christian, both in mine own eyes, and
also in the eyes of others; I was once, as I thought,
fair for the Celestial City, and had even joy at the
thoughts that I should get thither."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Well, but what art thou now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man.</span> I am now a man of despair, and am shut
up in it, as in this iron cage. I cannot get out.
Oh, <i>now</i> I cannot!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> But how camest thou in this condition?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man.</span> I left off to watch and be sober. I gave
free reins to sin; I sinned against the light of the
Word and the goodness of God; I have grieved
the Spirit, and He is gone; I tempted the devil,
and he has come to me; I have provoked God to
anger, and He has left me; I have so hardened
my heart that I <i>cannot</i> turn.</p>

<p>Then said Christian to the Interpreter, "But
are there no hopes for such a man as this?" "Ask
him," said the Interpreter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then said Christian, "Is there no hope,
but you must be kept in the iron cage of despair?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man.</span> No, none at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Why? the Son of the Blessed is very
pitiful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man.</span> I have crucified Him to myself afresh.
I have despised His person. I have despised His
holiness; I have counted His blood an unholy
thing; I have shown contempt to the Spirit of
mercy. Therefore I have shut myself out of all
the promises of God, and there now remains to me
nothing but threatenings, dreadful threatenings,
fearful threatenings of certain judgment and fiery
anger, which shall devour me as an enemy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> For what did you bring yourself into
this condition?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man.</span> For the desires, pleasures, and gains of
this world; in the enjoyment of which I did then
promise myself much delight; but now every one
of those things also bite me, and gnaw me, like a
burning worm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> But canst thou not now turn again to God?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man.</span> God no longer invites me to come to Him.
His Word gives me no encouragement to believe;
yea, Himself hath shut me up in this iron cage;
nor can all the men in the world let me out.
O eternity! eternity! how shall I grapple with the
misery that I must meet with in eternity?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> Then said the Interpreter to Christian,
"Let this man's misery be remembered by thee,
and be an everlasting caution to thee."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DREAM OF THE JUDGMENT</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "Well," said Christian, "this is fearful!
God help me to watch and be sober, and to pray,
that I may shun the cause of this man's misery.
Sir, is it not time for me to go on my way now?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> Tarry till I show thee one thing more,
and then thou shalt go on thy way.</p>

<p>So he took Christian by the hand again, and led
him into a chamber, where there was one rising
out of bed; and, as he put on his clothing, he
shook and trembled. Then said Christian, "Why
doth this man thus tremble?" The Interpreter
then bid him tell to Christian the reason of his so
doing. So he began, and said, "This night, as I
was in my sleep, I dreamed, and behold, the
heavens grew exceeding black; also it thundered
and lightened in most fearful manner, that it put
me into an agony. So I looked up in my dream,
and saw the clouds rack at an unusual rate; upon
which I heard a great sound of a trumpet, and saw
also a Man sitting upon a cloud, attended with the
thousands of heaven; they were all in flaming fire;
also the heavens were in a burning flame. I heard
then a great voice saying, 'Arise, ye dead, and
come to judgment.' And with that the rocks
rent, the graves opened, and the dead that were
therein came forth: some of them were exceeding
glad, and looked upward; and some thought to
hide themselves under the mountains. Then I
saw the Man that sat upon the cloud open the book
and bid the world draw near. Yet there was, by
reason of a fierce flame that issued out and came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
before Him, a certain distance betwixt Him and
them, as betwixt the judge and the prisoners at
the bar. I heard it also called out to them that
stood around on the Man that sat on the cloud,
'Gather together the tares, the chaff, and stubble,
and cast them into the burning lake. And, with
that, the bottomless pit opened, just whereabout
I stood; out of the mouth of which there came,
in an abundant manner, smoke and coals of fire,
with hideous noises. It was also said to the same
persons, 'Gather my wheat into the garner.'
And, with that, I saw many catched up and
carried away into the clouds; but I was left
behind. I also sought to hide myself, but I could
not; for the Man that sat upon the cloud still kept
His eye upon me; my sins also came into my mind,
and my conscience did accuse me on every side.
Upon this I awakened from my sleep."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> But what was it that made you so afraid
of this sight?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man.</span> Why I thought that the day of judgment
was come, and that I was not ready for it. But
this affrighted me most, that the angels gathered
up several, and left me behind; also the pit of hell
opened her mouth just where I stood. My conscience,
too, troubled me; and, as I thought, the
judge had always His eye upon me, showing anger
in His countenance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> Then said the Interpreter to Christian,
"Hast thou considered these things?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Yes; and they put me in hope and fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> Well, keep all things so in thy mind,
that they may be as a goad in thy sides, to prick
thee forward in the way thou must go.</p>

<p>Then Christian began to gird up his loins, and to
address himself to his journey. Then said the
Interpreter, "The Comforter be always with thee,
good Christian, to guide thee into the way that
leads to the city."</p>

<p>So Christian went on his way, saying:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Here have I seen things rare and profitable;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Things pleasant, dreadful; things to make me stable</span><br />
<span class="i0">In what I have begun to take in hand:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then let me think on them, and understand</span><br />
<span class="i0">Wherefore they showed me where; and let me be</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thankful, O good Interpreter, to thee."</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>Now, I saw in my dream that the highway
up which Christian was to go was fenced
on either side with a wall that was called
Salvation. Up this way, therefore, did burdened
Christian run, but not without great difficulty,
because of the load on his back.</p>

<p>He ran thus till he came to a place somewhat
ascending; and upon that place stood a Cross, and
a little below, in the bottom, a tomb. So I saw
in my dream, that just as Christian came up with
the cross, his burden loosed from off his shoulders,
and fell from off his back, and began to tumble,
and so continued to do till it came to the mouth
of the tomb, where it fell in, and I saw it no more.<a name="Cross" id="Cross"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_057.jpg" width="400" height="604" alt="Christian Before the Cross." title="Christian Before the Cross." />
<span class="caption">Christian Before the Cross.<br />
<small>See page 50</small></span>
</div>

<p>Then was Christian glad and lightsome, and
said with a merry heart, "He hath given me rest
by His sorrow, and life by His death." Then he
stood still awhile to look and wonder; for it was
very surprising to him that the sight of the cross
should thus ease him of his burden. He looked,
therefore, and looked again, even till the springs
that were in his head sent the water down his
cheeks. Now, as he stood looking and weeping,
behold, three Shining Ones came to him, and
saluted him with "Peace be to thee." So the first
said to him, "Thy sins be forgiven thee;" the
second stripped him of his rags, and clothed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
with a change of garments; the third also set a
mark on his forehead, and gave him a roll with a
seal upon it, which he bade him look on as he ran,
and that he should give it in at the heavenly gate;
so they went their way. Then Christian gave
three leaps for joy, and went on, singing:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Thus far did I come laden with my sin;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nor could aught ease the grief that I was in,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till I came hither; what a place is this!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Must here be the beginning of my bliss?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Must here the burden fall from off my back?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Must here the strings that bound it to me crack?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Blest cross! blest sepulchre! blest rather be</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Man that was there put to shame for me!"</span>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">SIMPLE, SLOTH, PRESUMPTION</div>

<p>I saw then in my dream that he went on thus,
even until he came to the bottom, where he saw,
a little out of the way, three men fast asleep, with
fetters upon their heels. The name of one was
Simple, of another Sloth, and of the third Presumption.</p>

<p>Christian, then, seeing them lie in this case,
went to them, if perhaps he might awake them,
and cried, "You are like them that sleep on the
top of a mast; for the deep sea is under you, a gulf
that hath no bottom: awake, therefore, and come
away; be willing, also, and I will help you off with
your irons." He also told them, "If he that goeth
about like a roaring lion comes by, you will certainly
become a prey to his teeth." With that
they looked upon him, and began to reply in this
sort: Simple said, "I see no danger." Sloth said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
"Yet a little more sleep." And Presumption said,
"Every tub must stand upon his own bottom."
And so they lay down to sleep again, and Christian
went on his way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FORMALIST AND HYPOCRISY</div>

<p>Yet was he troubled to think that men in that
danger should so little care for the kindness of him
that so offered to help them, both by awakening
of them, advising them, and offering to help them
off with their irons. And, as he was troubled
thereabout, he espied two men come tumbling over
the wall on the left hand of the narrow way; and
they made up apace to him. The name of one
was Formalist, and the name of the other was
Hypocrisy. So, as I said, they drew up unto
him, who thus began talking with them:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Gentlemen, whence came you, and
whither go you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Form.</span> and <span class="smcap">Hyp.</span> We were born in the land of
Vain-glory, and are going for praise to Mount
Zion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Why came you not in at the gate which
standeth at the beginning of the way? Know ye
not that it is written, "He that cometh not in by
the door, but climbeth up some other way, the
same is a thief and a robber?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Form.</span> and <span class="smcap">Hyp.</span> They said that to go to the
gate for entrance was, by all their countrymen,
counted too far about; and that therefore their
usual way was to make a short cut of it, and to
climb over the wall as they had done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> But will it not be counted a trespass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
against the Lord of the city whither we are bound,
thus to disobey His will?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Form.</span> and <span class="smcap">Hyp.</span> They told him, that as for
that, he needed not trouble his head thereabout;
for what they did they had custom for, and could
show, if need were, testimony that could prove it
for more than a thousand years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "But," said Christian, "will it stand a
trial at law?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Form.</span> and <span class="smcap">Hyp.</span> They told him that custom, it
being of so long standing as above a thousand
years, would doubtless now be admitted as a thing
according to law by a fair judge. "And besides,"
said they, "if we get into the way, what matter is
it which way we may get in? If we are in, we are
in: thou art but in the way, who, as we perceive,
came in at the gate; and we are also in the way,
that came tumbling over the wall: wherein, now,
is thy condition better than ours?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I walk by the rule of my Master; you
walk by the rude working of your fancies. You
are counted thieves already by the Lord of the
way; therefore I doubt you will not be found true
men at the end of the way. You come in by
yourselves without His word, and shall go out by
yourselves without His mercy.</p>

<p>To this they made him but little answer; only
they bid him look to himself. Then I saw that
they went on every man in his way, without much
talking one with another; save that these two men
told Christian, that, as to law and rules, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
doubted not but that they should as carefully do
them as he. "Therefore," said they, "we see not
wherein thou differest from us, but by the coat
which is on thy back, which was, as we believe
given thee by some of thy neighbors to hide the
shame of thy nakedness."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> By laws and rules you will not be saved,
since you came not in by the door. And as for
this coat that is on my back, it was given to me by
the Lord of the place whither I go; and that, as
you say, to cover my nakedness with. And I take
it as a token of His kindness to me; for I had
nothing but rags before. And besides, thus I comfort
myself as I go. Surely, think I, when I come
to the gate of the city, the Lord thereof will know
me for good, since I have His coat on my back;
a coat that He gave me freely in the day that He
stripped me of my rags. I have moreover, a mark
in my forehead, of which perhaps you have taken
no notice, which one of my Lord's most intimate
friends fixed there the day that my burden fell off
my shoulders. I will tell you, moreover, that I
had then given me a roll sealed, to comfort me
by reading as I go in the way; I was also bid to
give it in at the heavenly gate, in token of my
certain going in after it; all which things, I doubt,
you want, and want them because you came not in
at the gate.</p>

<p>To these things they gave him no answer; only
they looked upon each other, and laughed. Then
I saw that they went on all, save that Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
kept before, who had no more talk but with himself,
and sometimes sighingly, and sometimes
comfortably; also he would be often reading in
the roll that one of the Shining Ones gave him, by
which he was refreshed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY</div>

<p>I beheld then that they all went on till they
came to the foot of the Hill Difficulty, at the bottom
of which was a spring. There were also in
the same place two other ways, besides that which
came straight from the gate; one turned to the
left hand, and the other to the right, at the bottom
of the hill; but the narrow way lay right up the
hill, and the name of that going up the side of the
hill is called Difficulty. Christian now went to
the spring, and drank thereof to refresh himself,
and then began to go up the hill, saying:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The hill, though high, I covet to ascend;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The difficulty will not me offend,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For I perceive the way to life lies here.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Come, pluck up, heart, let's neither faint nor fear.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Better, though <i>difficult</i>, the right way to go,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Than wrong, though <i>easy</i>, where the end is woe."</span>
</div>

<p>The other two also came to the foot of the hill.
But when they saw that the hill was steep and
high, and that there were two other ways to go;
and supposing also that these two ways might
meet again with that up which Christian went, on
the other side of the hill; therefore they were
resolved to go in those ways. Now, the name of
one of those ways was Danger, and the name of
the other Destruction. So the one took the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
which is called Danger, which led him into a great
wood; and the other took directly up the way to
destruction, which led him into a wide field, full
of dark mountains, where he stumbled and fell,
and rose no more.</p>

<p>I looked then after Christian, to see him go up
the hill, where I perceived he fell from running to
going, and from going to clambering upon his
hands and his knees, because of the steepness of
the place. Now, about the midway to the top of
the hill was a pleasant arbor, made by the Lord of
the hill for the refreshment of weary travelers.
Thither, therefore, Christian got, where also he
sat down to rest him; then he pulled his roll out
of his bosom, and read therein to his comfort; he
also now began afresh to take a review of the coat
or garment that was given him as he stood by the
cross. Thus pleasing himself a while, he at last
fell into a slumber, and thence into a fast sleep,
which detained him in that place until it was
almost night; and in his sleep his roll fell out of
his hand. Now, as he was sleeping, there came
one to him, and awaked him, saying, "Go to the
ant, thou sluggard;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> consider her ways, and
be wise." And, with that, Christian suddenly
started up, and sped on his way, and went apace
till he came to the top of the hill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TIMOROUS AND MISTRUST</div>

<p>Now, when he was got up to the top of the hill,
there came two men running amain: the name of
the one was Timorous, and of the other Mistrust;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to whom Christian said, "Sirs, what's the matter?
You run the wrong way." Timorous answered,
that they were going to the city of Zion, and had
got up that difficult place: "but," said he, "the
farther we go, the more danger we meet with;
wherefore we turned, and are going back again."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mistrust, "for just before us lie a
couple of lions in the way, whether sleeping or
waking we know not; and we could not think, if
we came within reach, but they would presently
pull us in pieces."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then said Christian, "You make me
afraid; but whither shall I fly to be safe? If I go
back to my own country, that is prepared for fire
and brimstone, and I shall certainly perish there;
if I can get to the Celestial City, I am sure to be in
safety there: I must venture. To go back is
nothing but death; to go forward is fear of death,
and life everlasting beyond it. I will yet go forward."
So Mistrust and Timorous ran down the
hill, and Christian went on his way. But, thinking
again of what he heard from the men, he felt in
his bosom for his roll, and found it not. Then was
Christian in great distress, and knew not what to
do; for he wanted that which used to comfort
him, and that which should have been his pass
into the Celestial City. Here, therefore, he began
to be greatly troubled, and knew not what to do.
At last he bethought himself that he had slept in
the arbor that is on the side of the hill; and, falling
down upon his knees, he asked God's forgiveness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
for that his foolish act, and then went back to look
for his roll. But all the way he went back, who
can sufficiently set forth the sorrow of Christian's
heart? Sometimes he sighed, sometimes he wept,
and oftentimes he blamed himself for being so
foolish to fall asleep in that place, which was
erected only for a little refreshment from his
weariness. Thus, therefore, he went back, carefully
looking on this side and on that, all the way
as he went, if happily he might find his roll that
had been his comfort so many times in his journey.
He went thus till he came again within sight of the
arbor where he sat and slept; but that sight
renewed his sorrow the more, by bringing again,
even afresh, his evil of sleeping into his mind.
Thus, therefore, he now went on, bewailing his
sinful sleep, saying, "O wretched man that I am,
that I should sleep in the day-time; that I should
sleep in the midst of difficulty! that I should so
indulge myself, as to use that rest for ease to my
flesh which the Lord of the hill hath builded only
for the relief of the spirits of pilgrims! How many
steps have I taken in vain! Thus it happened to
Israel; for their sin they were sent back again by
the way of the Red Sea; and I am made to tread
those steps with sorrow which I might have trod
with delight, had it not been for this sinful sleep.
How far might I have been on my way by this
time! I am made to tread those steps thrice
over which I needed not to have trod but
once; yea, also, now I am like to be benighted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
for the day is almost spent. Oh that I had not
slept!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTIAN RECOVERS HIS ROLL</div>

<p>Now, by this time he was come to the arbor
again, where for awhile he sat down and wept;
but at last (as Providence would have it), looking
sorrowfully down under the settle, there he espied
his roll, the which he, with trembling and haste,
caught up, and put it into his bosom. But who
can tell how joyful this man was when he had
got his roll again? for this roll was the assurance
of his life and acceptance at the desired haven.
Therefore he laid it up in his bosom, giving thanks
to God for directing his eye to the place where it
lay, and with joy and tears betook himself again
to his journey. But oh, how nimbly now did he
go up the rest of the hill! Yet, before he got up,
the sun went down upon Christian; and this made
him again recall the folly of his sleeping to his
remembrance; and thus he began again to condole
with himself, "Oh, thou sinful sleep! how for
thy sake am I like to be benighted in my journey.
I must walk without the sun, darkness must cover
the path of my feet, and I must hear the noise of
the doleful creatures, because of my sinful sleep."
Now also he remembered the story that Mistrust
and Timorous told him, of how they were frighted
with the sight of the lions. Then said Christian
to himself again, "These beasts range in the night
for their prey; and if they should meet with me
in the dark, how should I avoid them? how should
I escape being torn in pieces?" Thus he went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
his way. But, while he was thus bewailing his
unhappy mistake, he lifted up his eyes, and behold
there was a very stately palace before him, the
name of which was Beautiful, and it stood just by
the highway side.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WATCHFUL THE PORTER</div>

<p>So I saw in my dream that he made haste, and
went forward, that, if possible, he might get
lodging there. Now, before he had gone far, he
entered into a very narrow passage, which was
about a furlong off the Porter's lodge; and looking
very narrowly before him as he went, he espied
two lions in the way. Now, thought he, I see the
dangers by which Mistrust and Timorous were
driven back. (The lions were chained, but he saw
not the chains). Then he was afraid, and thought
also himself to go back after them; for he thought
nothing but death was before him. But the
Porter at the lodge, whose name is Watchful, perceiving
that Christian made a halt as if he would
go back, cried out unto him, saying, "Is thy
strength so small? fear not the lions, for they are
chained, and are placed there for the trial of faith
where it is, and for the finding out of those that
have none: keep in the midst of the path, and no
hurt shall come unto thee."</p>

<p>Then I saw that he went on trembling for fear
of the lions; but, taking good heed to the words
of the Porter, he heard them roar, but they did
him no harm. Then he clapped his hands, and
went on till he came and stood before the gate
where the Porter was. Then said Christian to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the Porter, "Sir, what house is this? and may I
lodge here to-night?"</p>

<p>The Porter answered, "This house was built by
the Lord of the hill, and He built it for the relief
and security of pilgrims." The Porter also asked
whence he was, and whither he was going.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I am come from the City of Destruction,
and am going to Mount Zion; but, because the sun
is now set, I desire, if I may, to lodge here to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Port.</span> What is your name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> My name is now Christian, but my name
at the first was Graceless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Port.</span> But how doth it happen that you come
so late? The sun is set.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I had been here sooner, but that,
wretched man that I am, I slept in the arbor that
stands on the hill-side. Nay, I had, notwithstanding
that, been here much sooner, but that in
my sleep I lost my roll, and came without it to the
brow of the hill; and then, feeling for it and finding
it not, I was forced with sorrow of heart to go
back to the place where I slept my sleep, where I
found it; and now I am come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Port.</span> Well, I will call out one of the women of
this place, who will, if she likes your talk, bring
you in to the rest of the family, according to the
rules of the house.</p>

<p>So Watchful the Porter rang a bell, at the sound
of which came out of the door of the house a grave
and beautiful young woman, named Discretion,
and asked why she was called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>The Porter answered, "This man is on a journey
from the City of Destruction to Mount Zion; but,
being weary and benighted, he asked me if he
might lodge here to-night; so I told him I would
call for thee, who, after speaking with him, mayest
do as seemeth thee good, even according to the
law of the house."</p>

<div class="sidenote">PIETY, PRUDENCE, CHARITY</div>

<p>Then she asked him whence he was, and whither
he was going; and he told her. She asked him
also how he got into the way; and he told her.
Then she asked him what he had seen and met
with on the way; and he told her. And at last
she asked his name. So he said, "It is Christian;
and I have so much the more a desire to lodge here
to-night, because, by what I perceive, this place
was built by the Lord of the hill for the relief and
safety of pilgrims." So she smiled, but the water
stood in her eyes; and after a little pause, she
said, "I will call forth two or three of my family."
So she ran to the door, and called out Prudence,
Piety, and Charity, who, after a little more discourse
with him brought him in to the family; and
many of them, meeting him at the threshold of
the house, said, "Come in, thou blessed of the
Lord: this house was built by the Lord of the hill
on purpose to entertain such pilgrims in." Then
he bowed his head, and followed them into the
house. So, when he was come in and sat down,
they gave him something to drink, and agreed
together, that, until supper was ready, some of
them should talk with Christian, for the best use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of the time; and they appointed Piety, Prudence,
and Charity to talk with him; and thus they
began:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Piety.</span> Come, good Christian since we have been
so loving to you to receive you into our house this
night, let us, if perhaps we may better ourselves
thereby, talk with you of all things that have
happened to you in your pilgrimage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> With a very good will, and I am glad
that you are so well disposed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Piety.</span> What moved you at first to betake
yourself to a pilgrim's life?</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTIAN'S ADVENTURES</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I was driven out of my native country
by a dreadful sound that was in mine ears; to wit,
that certain destruction did await me, if I abode
in that place where I was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Piety.</span> But how did it happen that you came
out of your country this way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> It was as God would have it; for, when
I was under the fears of destruction, I did not
know whither to go; but by chance there came a
man even to me, as I was trembling and weeping,
whose name is Evangelist, and he directed me to
the wicket-gate, which else I should never have
found, and so set me in the way that hath led me
directly to this house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Piety.</span> But did you not come by the house of
the Interpreter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Yes, and did see such things there, the
remembrance of which will stick by me as long as
I live, especially three things; to wit, how Christ,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in despite of Satan, the Evil One maintains His
work of grace in the heart; how the man had
sinned himself quite out of hopes of God's mercy;
and also the dream of him that thought in his
sleep the day of judgment was come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Piety.</span> Why? did you hear him tell his dream?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Yes, and a dreadful one it was, I thought
it made my heart ache as he was telling of it; but
yet I am glad I heard of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Piety.</span> Was that all you saw at the house of the
Interpreter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> No; he took me, and had me where he
showed me a stately palace; and how the people
were clad in gold that were in it; and how there
came a venturous man, and cut his way through
the armed men that stood in the door to keep him
out; and how he was bid to come in and win
eternal glory. Methought those things did delight
my heart. I would have stayed at that good
man's house a twelvemonth, but that I knew I
had farther to go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Piety.</span> And what saw you else in the way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Saw? Why, I went but a little farther,
and I saw One, as I thought in my mind, hang
bleeding upon a tree; and the very sight of Him
made my burden fall off my back; for I groaned
under a very heavy burden, and then it fell down
from off me. It was a strange thing to me, for I
never saw such a thing before; yea, and while I
stood looking up (for then I could not forbear
looking), three Shining Ones came to me. One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
them told me that my sins were forgiven me;
another stripped me of my rags, and gave me this
broidered coat which you see; and the third set
the mark which you see in my forehead, and gave
me this sealed roll. (And, with that, he plucked
it out of his bosom.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Piety.</span> But you saw more than this, did you
not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> The things that I have told you were
the best; yet some other matters I saw; as namely
I saw three men, Simple, Sloth, and Presumption,
lie asleep, a little out of the way as I came, with
irons upon their heels; but do you think I could
wake them? I also saw Formalist and Hypocrisy
come tumbling over the wall, to go, as they pretended,
to Zion; but they were quickly lost, even
as I myself did tell them, but they would not
believe. But, above all, I found it hard work to
get up this hill, and as hard to come by the lions'
mouths; and truly, if it had not been for the good
man the Porter, that stands at the gate, I do not
know but that, after all, I might have gone back
again; but now I thank God I am here, and I
thank you for receiving of me.</p>

<p>Then Prudence thought good to ask him a few
questions, and desired his answer to them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pru.</span> Do you think sometimes of the country
from whence you came?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Yes, but with much shame and detestation.
Truly, if I had been mindful of that country
from whence I came out, I might have had an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
opportunity to have returned; but now I desire a
better country, that is, a heavenly one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pru.</span> Do you not yet bear away with you in
your thoughts some of the things that you did in
the former time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Yes, but greatly against my will; especially
my inward and sinful thoughts, with which
all my countrymen, as well as myself, were
delighted. But now all those things are my grief;
and, might I but choose mine own things, I would
choose never to think of those things more; but
when I would be doing that which is best, that
which is worst is with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pru.</span> Do you not find sometimes as if those
things were overcome, which at other times are
your trouble?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Yes, but that is but seldom; but they
are to me golden hours in which such things happen
to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pru.</span> Can you remember by what means you
find your annoyances, at times, as if they were
overcome?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Yes; when I think what I saw at the
cross, that will do it; and when I look upon my
broidered coat, that will do it; also when I look
into the roll that I carry in my bosom, that will
do it; and when my thoughts wax warm about
whither I am going, that will do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pru.</span> And what makes you so desirous to go to
Mount Zion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Why, there I hope to see Him alive that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
did hang dead on the cross; and there I hope to be
rid of all these things that to this day are in me an
annoyance to me. There, they say, there is no
death; and there I shall dwell with such company
as I like best. For, to tell you the truth, I love
Him because I was by Him eased of my burden;
and I am weary of my inward sickness. I would
fain be where I shall die no more, and with the
company that shall continually cry, "Holy, holy,
holy!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARITY TALKS WITH CHRISTIAN</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Char.</span> Then said Charity to Christian, "Have
you a family? are you a married man?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I have a wife and four small children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Char.</span> And why did you not bring them along
with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then Christian wept, and said, "Oh,
how willingly would I have done it! but they were
all of them utterly against my going on pilgrimage."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Char.</span> But you should have talked to them,
and endeavored to have shown them the danger
of staying behind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> So I did, and told them also what God
had shown to me of the destruction of our city;
but I seemed to them as one that mocked, and
they believed me not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Char.</span> And did you pray to God that He would
bless your words to them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Yes, and that with much affection; for
you must think that my wife and poor children
are very dear unto me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span><span class="smcap">Char.</span> But did you tell them of your own sorrow
and fear of destruction? for I suppose that
you could see your destruction before you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Yes, over, and over, and over. They
might also see my fears in my countenance, in my
tears, and also in my trembling under the fear of
the judgment that did hang over our heads: but
all was not enough to prevail with them to come
with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Char.</span> But what could they say for themselves
why they came not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Why, my wife was afraid of losing this
world, and my children were given to the foolish
delights of youth; so, what by one thing, and
what by another, they left me to wander in this
manner alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Char.</span> But did you not, with your vain life,
hinder all that you by words used by way of persuasion
to bring them away with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Indeed, I cannot commend my life, for
I am conscious to myself of many failings therein.
I know also, that a man, by his actions may soon
overthrow what, by proofs or persuasion, he doth
labor to fasten upon others for their good. Yet
this I can say, I was very wary of giving them
occasion, by any unseemly action, to make them
averse to going on pilgrimage. Yea, for this very
thing they would tell me I was too precise, and
that I denied myself of things (for their sakes) in
which they saw no evil. Nay, I think I may say
that, if what they saw in me did hinder them, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
was my great tenderness in sinning against God,
or of doing any wrong to my neighbor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Char.</span> Indeed, Cain hated his brother because
his own works were evil, and his brother's
righteous; and, if thy wife and children have been
offended with thee for this, they thereby show
themselves to be resolutely opposed to good: thou
hast freed thy soul from their blood.</p>

<p>Now I saw in my dream, that thus they sat
talking together till supper was ready. So, when
they had made ready, they sat down to meat.
Now, the table was furnished with fat things, and
wine that was well refined; and all their talk at
the table was about the Lord of the hill; as,
namely, about what He had done, and wherefore
He did what He did, and why He had builded that
house; and by what they said, I perceived that
He had been a great warrior, and had fought with
and slain him that had the power of death, but
not without great danger to Himself, which made
me love Him the more.</p>

<p>For, as they said, and as I believe (said Christian),
He did it with the loss of much blood. But
that which puts the glory of grace into all He did,
was, that He did it out of pure love to this country.
And, besides, there were some of them of the
household that said they had seen and spoken with
Him since He did die on the cross; and they have
declared that they had it from His own lips, that
He is such a lover of poor pilgrims, that the like is
not to be found from the east to the west. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
moreover gave an instance of what they affirmed;
and that was, He had stripped Himself of His
glory, that He might do this for the poor; and
that they had heard Him say and affirm that He
would not dwell in the mountains of Zion alone.
They said, moreover, that He had made many
pilgrims princes, though by nature they were
beggars born, and their home had been the dunghill.</p>

<p>Thus they talked together till late at night; and
after they had committed themselves to their Lord
for protection, they betook themselves to rest.
The Pilgrim they laid in a large upper chamber,
whose window opened towards the sunrising.
The name of the chamber was Peace, where he
slept till break of day, and then he awoke and
sang:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Where am I now? Is this the love and care</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of Jesus, for the men that pilgrims are,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thus to provide that I should be forgiven,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And dwell already the next door to heaven?"</span>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE VIRGINS READ TO CHRISTIAN</div>

<p>So in the morning they all got up; and after
some more talking together, they told him that
he should not depart till they had shown him the
rarities of that place. And first they took him
into the study, where they showed him records of
the greatest age; in which, as I remember in my
dream, they showed him first the history of the
Lord of the hill, that He was the son of the
Ancient of Days, and had lived from the beginning.
Here also were more fully written the acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
that He had done, and the names of many hundreds
that He had taken into his service; and how
he had placed them in such houses that could
neither by length of days nor decays of nature be
destroyed.</p>

<p>Then they read to him some of the worthy acts
that some of His servants had done; as, how they
had conquered kingdoms, wrought righteousness,
obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of
the sword, out of weakness were made strong,
waxed valiant in fight, and turned to flight the
armies of the enemies.</p>

<p>They then read again in another part of the
records of the house, where it was shown how
willing their Lord was to receive into His favor any
even any, though they in time past had done
great wrongs to His person and rule. Here also
were several other histories of many other famous
things, of all which Christian had a view; as of
things both ancient and modern, together with
prophecies and foretellings of things that surely
come to pass, both to the dread and wonder of
enemies, and the comfort and happiness of
pilgrims.</p>

<p>The next day they took him and led him into
the armory, where they showed him all manner of
weapons which their Lord had provided for
pilgrims; as sword, shield, helmet, breast-plate,
all-prayer, and shoes that would not wear out.
And there was here enough of this to harness out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
as many men for the service of their Lord as there
be stars in the heaven for multitude.</p>

<p>They also showed him some of the things with
which some of His servants had done wonderful
things. They showed him Moses' rod; the hammer
and nail with which Jael slew Sisera; the
pitchers, trumpets, and lamps too, with which
Gideon put to flight the armies of Midian. Then
they showed him the ox's goad wherewith Shamgar
slew six hundred men. They showed him also
the jaw-bone with which Samson did such mighty
feats. They showed him, moreover, the sling and
stone with which David slew Goliath of Gath, and
the sword also with which their Lord will kill the
Man of Sin, in the day that He shall rise up to the
battle. They showed him, besides, many excellent
things, with which Christian was much
delighted. This done, they went to their rest
again.</p>

<p>Then I saw in my dream that on the morrow
he got up to go forward, but they desired him to
stay till the next day also; "and then," said they,
"we will, if the day be clear, show you the Delectable
Mountains;" which they said would yet
further add to his comfort, because they were
nearer the desired haven than the place where at
present he was. So he consented and stayed.
When the morning was up, they led him to the
top of the house, and bid him look south. So he
did, and behold, at a great distance he saw a most
pleasant mountainous country, beautified with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
woods, vineyards, fruits of all sorts, flowers also,
with springs and fountains, very lovely to behold.
Then he asked the name of the country. They
said it was Immanuel's Land; "and it is as common,"
said they, "as this hill is, to and for all the
pilgrims. And when thou comest there, from
thence thou mayest see to the gate of the Celestial
City, as the shepherds that live there will make
appear."</p>

<p>Now he bethought himself of setting forward,
and they were willing he should. "But first,"
said they, "let us go again into the armory." So
they did; and when he came there, they dressed
him from head to foot with armor of proof, lest
perhaps he should meet with assaults in the way.
He being, therefore, thus armed, walked out with
his friends to the gate; and there he asked the
Porter if he saw any pilgrim pass by. Then the
Porter answered, "Yes."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "Pray, did you know him?" said he.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Port.</span> I asked his name, and he told me it was
Faithful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "Oh," said Christian, "I know him, he is
my townsman, my near neighbor; he comes from
the place where I was born. How far do you think
he may be before?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Port.</span> He has got by this time below the hill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "Well," said Christian, "good Porter,
the Lord be with thee, and add to all thy blessings
much increase for the kindness thou has shown
to me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>Then he began to go forward; but Discretion,
Piety, Charity, and Prudence would accompany
him down to the foot of the hill. So they went on
together repeating their former discourses, till they
came to go down the hill. Then said Christian,
"As it was difficult coming up, so far so as I can
see, it is dangerous going down." "Yes," said
Prudence, "so it is; for it is a hard matter for a
man to go down the Valley of Humiliation, as
thou art now, and to catch no slip by the way;
therefore," said they, "are we come out to accompany
thee down the hill." So he began to go
down, but very warily; yet he caught a slip or two.</p>

<p>Then I saw in my dream that these good companions,
when Christian was gone down to the
bottom of the hill, gave him a loaf of bread, a
bottle of wine, and a cluster of raisins; and then
he went his way.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>But now, in this Valley of Humiliation, poor
Christian was hard put to it; for he had
gone but a little way before he espied a
foul fiend coming over the field to meet him: his
name is Apollyon. Then did Christian begin to be
afraid, and to cast in his mind whether to go back
or to stand his ground. But he considered again
that he had no armor for his back, and therefore
thought that to turn the back to him might give
him greater advantage with ease to pierce him
with darts; therefore he resolved to venture and
stand his ground; for, thought he, had I no more
in mine eye than the saving of my life, it would be
the best way to stand. So he went on, and Apollyon
met him. Now, the monster was hideous to
behold: he was clothed with scales like a fish, and
they are his pride; he had wings like a dragon,
and feet like a bear, and out of his belly came fire
and smoke; and his mouth was as the mouth of a
lion. When he was come up to Christian, he beheld
him with a disdainful countenance, and thus
began to question with him:</p>

<div class="sidenote">APOLLYON STAYS CHRISTIAN</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Apollyon.</span> Whence come you, and whither are
you bound?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I am come from the City of Destruction,
which is the place of all evil, and am going to the
City of Zion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span><span class="smcap">Apol.</span> By this I perceive that thou art one of
my subjects; for all that country is mine, and I
am the prince and God of it. How is it then
that thou hast run away from thy king? Were it
not that I hope that thou mayest do me more
service, I would strike thee now at one blow to the
ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I was indeed born in your kingdom;
but your service was hard, and your wages such as
a man could not live on; for the wages of sin is
death; therefore, when I was come to years, I did
as other thoughtful persons do, look out, if perhaps
I might mend myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apol.</span> There is no prince that will thus lightly
lose his subjects, neither will I as yet lose thee;
but, since thou complainest of thy service and
wages, be content to go back, and what our country
will afford I do here promise to give thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> But I have let myself to another, even
to the King of princes; and how can I with fairness
go back with thee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apol.</span> Thou hast done in this according to the
proverb, "changed a bad for a worse;" but it is
common for those that have called themselves
His servants, after awhile to give Him the slip,
and return again to me. Do thou so too, and all
shall be well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I have given Him my faith, and sworn
my service to Him; how, then, can I go back from
this, and not be hanged as a traitor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apol.</span> Thou didst the same to me, and yet I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
willing to pass by all, if now thou wilt yet turn
again and go back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> What I promised thee was in my youth,
and besides, I count that the Prince under whose
banner I now stand is able to set me free, yea, and
to pardon also what I did as to my service with
thee. And besides, O thou destroying Apollyon,
to speak the truth, I like His service, His wages,
His servants, His government, His company, and
country, better than thine; therefore leave off to
persuade me further: I am His servant, and I will
follow Him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apol.</span> Consider again when thou art in cold
blood, what thou art likely to meet with in the
way that thou goest. Thou knowest that for the
most part His servants come to an ill end, because
they are disobedient against me and my ways.
How many of them have been put to shameful
deaths! And besides, thou countest His service
better than mine; whereas He never came yet
from the place where He is, to deliver any that
served Him out of their hands; but as for me,
how many times, as all the world very well knows,
have I delivered, either by power or fraud, those
that have faithfully served me, from Him and His,
though taken by them! And so I will deliver thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> His forbearing at present to deliver them
is on purpose to try their love, whether they will
cleave to Him to the end; and, as for the ill end
thou sayest they come to, that is most glorious in
their account. For, for present deliverance, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
do not much expect it; for they stay for their
glory, and then they shall have it when their
prince comes in His and the glory of the angels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apol.</span> Thou hast already been unfaithful in
thy service to Him; and how dost thou think to
receive wages of Him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Wherein, O Apollyon, have I been
unfaithful to Him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apol.</span> Thou didst faint at first setting out, when
thou wast almost choked in the Gulf of Despond.
Thou didst attempt wrong ways to be rid of thy
burden, whereas thou shouldst have stayed till
thy Prince had taken it off. Thou didst sinfully
sleep and lose thy choice things. Thou wast
almost persuaded to go back at the sight of the
lions. And when thou talkest of thy journey, and
of what thou hast seen and heard, thou art
inwardly desirous of glory to thyself in all that
thou sayest or doest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> All this is true, and much more which
thou hast left out; but the Prince whom I serve
and honor is merciful and ready to forgive. But
besides, these infirmities possessed me in thy own
country; for there I sucked them in, and I have
groaned under them, been sorry for them, and
have obtained pardon of my Prince.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apol.</span> Then Apollyon broke out into a grievous
rage, saying, "I am an enemy to this Prince;
I hate His person, His laws, and people. I am
come out on purpose to withstand thee."</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTIAN THE CONQUEROR</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Apollyon, beware what you do, for I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
in the King's highway, the way of holiness: therefore
take heed to yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apol.</span> Then Apollyon straddled quite over the
whole breadth of the way, and said, "I am void of
fear in this matter. Prepare thyself to die; for I
swear by my infernal den, that thou shalt go no
farther: here will I spill thy soul." And, with
that, he threw a flaming dart at his breast; but
Christian held a shield in his hand, with which he
caught, and so prevented the danger of that.</p>

<p>Then did Christian draw, for he saw it was time
to bestir him; and Apollyon as fast made at him,
throwing darts as thick as hail, by the which, notwithstanding
all that Christian could do to avoid
it, Apollyon wounded him in his head, his hand,
and foot. This made Christian give a little back;
Apollyon, therefore, followed his work amain, and
Christian again took courage, and resisted as manfully
as he could. This sore combat lasted for
above half a day, even till Christian was almost
quite spent. For you must know that Christian,
by reason of his wounds, must needs grow weaker
and weaker.</p>

<p>Then Apollyon, espying his opportunity, began
to gather up close to Christian, and, wrestling with
him, gave him a dreadful fall; and, with that,
Christian's sword flew out of his hand. Then said
Apollyon, "I am sure of thee now." And, with
that, he had almost pressed him to death, so that
Christian began to despair of life. But, as God
would have it, while Apollyon was fetching his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
last blow, thereby to make a full end of this good
man, Christian nimbly reached out his hand for
his sword, and caught it, saying, "Rejoice not
against me, O mine enemy: when I fall I shall
arise;" and, with that, gave him a deadly thrust,
which made him give back, as one that had
received his mortal wound. Christian, perceiving
that, made at him again, saying, "Nay, in all these
things we are more than conquerors through Him
that loved us." And, with that, Apollyon spread
forth his dragon's wings, and sped him away, that
Christian for a season saw him no more.</p>

<p>In this combat no man can imagine, unless he
had seen and heard, as I did, what yelling and
hideous roaring Apollyon made all the time of the
fight: he spake like a dragon; and, on the other
side, what sighs and groans burst from Christian's
heart. I never saw him all the while give so much
as one pleasant look, till he perceived he had
wounded Apollyon with his two-edged sword;
then, indeed, he did smile and look upward; but
it was the dreadfullest sight that ever I saw.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTIAN GIVES THANKS</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> So, when the battle was over, Christian
said, "I will here give thanks to Him that hath
delivered me out of the mouth of the lion; to Him
that did help me against Apollyon." And so he
did, saying:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Great Satan, the captain of this fiend,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Designed my ruin; therefore to this end</span><br />
<span class="i0">He sent him harnessed out: and he with rage</span><br />
<span class="i0">That hellish was, did fiercely me engage;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span><span class="i0">But blessed angels helped me; and I,</span><br />
<span class="i0">By dint of sword, did quickly make him fly:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Therefore to God let me give lasting praise,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And thank and bless His holy name always."</span>
</div>

<p>Then there came to him a hand with some of
the leaves of the tree of life; the which Christian
took, and laid upon the wounds that he had
received in the battle, and was healed immediately.
He also sat down in that place to eat bread, and to
drink of the bottle that was given to him a little
before: so, being refreshed, he went forth on his
journey, with his sword drawn in his hand; "For,"
he said, "I know not but some other enemy may
be at hand." But he met with no other harm
from Apollyon quite through this valley.</p>

<p>Now, at the end of this valley was another,
called the Valley of the Shadow of Death; and
Christian must needs go through it, because the
way to the Celestial City lay through the midst of
it. Now this valley is a very solitary place; the
prophet Jeremiah thus describes it: "A wilderness,
a land of deserts and pits, a land of drought, and of
the shadow of death, a land that no man" but a
Christian "passeth through, and where no man
dwelt."</p>

<p>Now here Christian was worse put to it than in
his fight with Apollyon, as in the story you shall
see.</p>

<p>I saw then in my dream, that when Christian
was got to the borders of the Shadow of Death,
there met him two men, children of them that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
brought up an evil report of the good land, making
haste to go back; to whom Christian spake as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Whither are you going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Men.</span> They said, "Back, back! and we would
have you to do so too, if either life or peace is
prized by you."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "Why, what's the matter?" said Christian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Men.</span> "Matter!" said they: "we were going that
way as you are going, and went as far as we durst:
and indeed we were almost past coming back;
for had we gone a little farther, we had not been
here to bring the news to thee."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "But what have you met with?" said
Christian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Men.</span> Why, we were almost in the Valley of the
Shadow of Death, but that by good hap we
looked before us, and saw the danger before we
came to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "But what have you seen?" said Christian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Men.</span> Seen! why, the valley itself, which is as
dark as pitch: we also saw there the hobgoblins,
satyrs, and dragons of the pit; we heard also in
that valley a continual howling and yelling, as of a
people under unutterable misery, who there sat
bound in affliction and irons; and over that hung
the discouraging clouds of confusion; Death also
does always spread his wings over it. In a word,
it is every whit dreadful, being utterly without
order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then said Christian, "I perceive not yet,
by what you have said, but that this is my way to
the desired haven."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Men.</span> Be it thy way, we will not choose it for
ours.</p>

<p>So they parted, and Christian went on his way,
but still with his sword drawn in his hand, for fear
lest he should be attacked.</p>

<p>I saw then in my dream, as far as this valley
reached, there was on the right hand a very deep
ditch; that ditch is it into which the blind have
led the blind in all ages, and have both there
miserably perished. Again, behold, on the left
hand there was a very dangerous quag, or marsh,
into which, if even a good man falls, he finds no
bottom for his foot to stand on: into that quag
King David once did fall, and had no doubt there
been smothered, had not He that is able plucked
him out.</p>

<p>The pathway was here also exceedingly narrow,
and therefore good Christian was the more put to
it; for when he sought, in the dark, to shun the
ditch, on the one hand he was ready to tip over
into the mire on the other; also when he sought to
escape the mire, without great carefulness he
would be ready to fall into the ditch. Thus he
went on, and I heard him here sigh bitterly, for
besides the danger mentioned above, the pathway
was here so dark, that ofttimes, when he lifted up
his foot to go forward, he knew not where or upon
what he should set it next.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A COMPANY OF FIENDS</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>About the midst of this valley I perceived the
mouth of hell to be, and it stood also hard by the
wayside. Now, thought Christian, what shall I
do? And ever and anon the flame and smoke
would come out in such abundance, with sparks
and hideous noises (things that cared not for
Christian's sword, as did Apollyon before), that he
was forced to put up his sword, and betake himself
to another weapon, called "All-Prayer." So he
cried in my hearing, "O Lord, I beseech Thee,
deliver my soul." Thus he went on a great while,
yet still the flames would be reaching towards
him; also he heard doleful voices, and rushings to
and fro, so that sometimes he thought he should
be torn in pieces, or trodden down like mire in the
streets. This frightful sight was seen, and those
dreadful noises were heard by him, for several
miles together, and, coming to a place where he
thought he heard a company of fiends coming
forward to meet him, he stopped, and began to
muse what he had best to do. Sometimes he had
half a thought to go back; then again he thought
he might be half-way through the valley. He remembered,
also, how he had already vanquished
many a danger, and that the danger of going back
might be much more than going forward. So he
resolved to go on; yet the fiends seemed to come
nearer and nearer. But, when they were come even
almost at him, he cried out with a most vehement
voice, "I will walk in the strength of the Lord
God." So they gave back, and came no farther.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VALLEY OF SHADOW OF DEATH</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>One thing I would not let slip: I took notice
that now poor Christian was so confounded that
he did not know his own voice; and thus I perceived
it: just when he was come over against the
mouth of the burning pit, one of the wicked ones
got behind him, and stepped up softly to him, and
whisperingly suggested many wicked words to
him, which he verily thought had proceeded from
his own mind. This put Christian more to it than
anything he had met with before, even to think
that he should now speak evil of Him that he had
so much loved before. Yet, if he could have
helped it, he would not have done it; but he had
not the wisdom either to stop his ears, or to know
from whence those wicked words came.</p>

<p>When Christian had traveled in this sorrowful
condition some considerable time he thought he
heard the voice of a man, as going before him,
saying, "Though I walk through the Valley of the
Shadow of Death I will fear no evil; for Thou art
with me."</p>

<p>Then he was glad, and that for these reasons:</p>

<p>First,&mdash;Because he gathered from thence, that
some who feared God were in this valley as well
as himself.</p>

<p>Secondly,&mdash;For that he perceived God was with
them, though in that dark and dismal state. And
why not, thought he, with me, though by reason
of the kindness that attends this place, I cannot
perceive it?</p>

<p>Thirdly,&mdash;For that he hoped (could he overtake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
them) to have company by-and-by. So he went
on, and called to him that was before; but he
knew not what to answer, for that he also thought
himself to be alone. And by-and-by the day
broke. Then said Christian, "He hath turned the
shadow of death into the morning."</p>

<p>Now, morning being come, he looked back, not
out of desire to return, but to see, by the light of
the day, what dangers he had gone through in the
dark. So he saw more perfectly the ditch that
was on the one hand, and the quag that was on
the other; also how narrow the way which led
betwixt them both. Also now he saw the hobgoblins,
and satyrs, and dragons of the pit, but all
afar off; for after break of day they came not nigh;
yet they were shown to him according to that
which is written, "He showeth deep things out of
darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow
of death."</p>

<p>Now was Christian much affected with his
deliverance from all the dangers of his solitary
way; which dangers, though he feared them much
before, yet he saw them more clearly now, because
the light of the day made them plain to him. And
about this time the sun was rising, and this was
another mercy to Christian; for you must note
that, though the first part of the Valley of the
Shadow of Death was dangerous, yet this second
part, which he was yet to go, was if possible far
more dangerous; for, from the place where he
now stood, even to the end of the valley, the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
was all along set so full of snares, traps, gins, and
nets here, and so full of pits, pitfalls, deep holes,
and shelvings down there, that, had it now been
dark, as it was when he came the first part of the
way, had he had a thousand souls, they had in
reason been cast away. But, as I said just now
the sun was rising. Then said he, "His candle
shineth on my head, and by His light I go through
darkness."</p>

<div class="sidenote">POPE AND PAGAN</div>

<p>In this light, therefore, he came to the end of
the valley. Now, I saw in my dream that at the
end of the valley lay blood, bones, ashes, and
mangled bodies of men, even of pilgrims that had
gone this way formerly; and, while I was musing
what should be the reason, I espied a little before
me a cave, where two giants, POPE and PAGAN,
dwelt in old time; by whose power and tyranny,
the men whose bones, blood, ashes, etc., lay there,
were cruelly put to death. But by this place
Christian went without danger, whereat I somewhat
wondered; but I have learnt since, that
Pagan has been dead many a day; and, as for the
other, though he be yet alive, he is, by reason of
age, also of the many shrewd brushes that he met
with in his younger days, grown so crazy and stiff
in his joints, that he can now do little more than
sit in his cave's mouth, grinning at pilgrims as
they go by, and biting his nails because he cannot
come to them.</p>

<p>So I saw that Christian went on his way; yet,
at the sight of the old man that sat at the mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of the cave, he could not tell what to think,
especially because he spoke to him, though he
could not go after him, saying, "You will never
mend till more of you be burned." But he held
his peace, and set a good face on it, and so went
by and caught no hurt. Then sang Christian:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>Now as Christian went on his way, he came
to a little ascent which was cast up on
purpose that pilgrims might see before
them: up there, therefore, Christian went; and
looking forward, he saw Faithful before him upon
his journey. Then said Christian aloud, "Ho, ho!
so-ho! stay, and I will be your companion." At
that Faithful looked behind him; to whom Christian
cried, "Stay, stay, till I come up to you." But
Faithful answered, "No, I am upon my life, and
the avenger of blood is behind me."</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTIAN JOINS FAITHFUL</div>

<p>At this Christian was somewhat moved; and
putting to all his strength, he quickly got up with
Faithful, and did also overrun him: so the last
was first. Then did Christian boastfully smile,
because he had gotten the start of his brother;
but, not taking good heed to his feet, he suddenly
stumbled and fell, and could not rise again until
Faithful came up to help him.</p>

<p>Then I saw in my dream, they went very
lovingly on together, and had sweet talk together
of all things that had happened to them in their
pilgrimage; and thus Christian began:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> My honored and well-beloved brother
Faithful, I am glad that I have overtaken you,
and that God has so tempered our spirits that we
can walk as companions in this so pleasant a path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> I had thought, dear friend, to have had
your company quite from our town; but you did
get the start of me, wherefore I was forced to
come thus much of the way alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> How long did you stay in the City of
Destruction before you set out after me on your
pilgrimage?</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHAT WAS SAID IN THE CITY</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Till I could stay no longer; for there
was great talk, presently after you were gone out,
that our city would, in a short time, with fire
from heaven, be burned down to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> What! did your neighbors talk so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Yes, it was for a while in everybody's
mouth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> What! and did no more of them but you
come out to escape the danger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Though there was, as I said, a great
talk thereabout, yet I do not think they did firmly
believe it. For, in the heat of the talking I heard
some of them deridingly speak of you, and of your
desperate journey; for so they called this your
pilgrimage. But I did believe, and do still, that
the end of our city will be with fire and brimstone
from above; and therefore I have made my escape.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Did you hear no talk of neighbor
Pliable?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Yes, Christian; I heard that he followed
you till he came to the Slough of Despond, where,
as some said, he fell in; but he would not be
known to have so done; but I am sure he was
soundly bedabbled with that kind of dirt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> And what said the neighbors to him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> He hath, since his going back, been held
greatly in derision, and that among all sorts of
people: some do mock and despise him, and
scarce any will set him on work. He is now seven
times worse than if he had never gone out of the
city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> But why should they be set so against
him, since they also despise the way that he
forsook?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> "Oh," they say, "hang him; he is a
turncoat! he was not true to his profession!"
I think God has stirred up even his enemies to
hiss at him and laugh at him, because he hath
forsaken the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Had you no talk with him before you
came out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> I met him once in the streets, but he
leered away on the other side, as one ashamed of
what he had done; so I spake not to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Well, at my first setting out, I had
hopes of that man, but now I fear he will perish
in the overthrow of the city. For it has happened
to him according to the true proverb, "The dog is
turned to his vomit again, and the sow that was
washed to her wallowing in the mire."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> These are my fears of him too; but
who can hinder that which will be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "Well, neighbor Faithful," said Christian,
"let us leave him, and talk of things that
more immediately concern ourselves. Tell me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
now what you have met with in the way as you
came; for I know you have met with some things,
or else it may be writ for a wonder."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> I escaped the slough that I perceive
you fell into, and got up to the gate without that
danger; only I met with one whose name was
Wanton, that had like to have done me a mischief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> It was well you escaped her net: Joseph
was hard put to it by her, and he escaped her as
you did; but it had like to have cost him his life.
But what did she do to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> You cannot think (but that you know
something) what a flattering tongue she had;
she lay at me hard to turn aside with her, promising
me all manner of enjoyment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Nay, she did not promise you the
enjoyment of a good conscience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> You know what I mean&mdash;not the enjoyment
of the soul, but of the body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Thank God you have escaped her: the
abhorred of the Lord shall fall into her ditch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Nay, I know not whether I did wholly
escape her or no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Why, I suppose you did not consent to
her desires?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> No, not to defile myself; for I remembered
an old writing that I had seen which saith,
"Her steps take hold of hell." So I shut mine
eyes, because I would not be bewitched with her
looks. Then she railed on me, and I went my
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Did you meet with no other assault as
you came?</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAITHFUL AND ADAM THE FIRST</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> When I came to the foot of the hill
called Difficulty, I met with a very aged man, who
asked me what I was and whither bound. I told
him that I was a pilgrim, going to the Celestial
City. Then said the old man, "Thou lookest like
an honest fellow: wilt thou be content to dwell
with me, for the wages that I shall give thee?"
Then I asked him his name, and where he dwelt.
He said his name was Adam the First, and that
he dwelt in the town of Deceit. I asked him then
what was his work, and what the wages that he
would give. He told me that his work was many
delights; and his wages, that I should be his heir
at last. I further asked him what house he kept,
and what other servants he had. So he told me
that his house was filled with all the dainties of the
world, and that his servants were his own children.
Then I asked him how many children he had. He
said that he had but three daughters, the Lust of
the Flesh, the Lust of the Eyes, and the Pride of
Life, and that I should marry them if I would.
Then I asked, how long time he would have me
live with him? And he told me, As long as he
lived himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Well, and what conclusion came the
old man and you to at last?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Why, at first I found myself somewhat
inclinable to go with the man, for I thought he
spake very fair; but looking in his forehead, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
talked with him, I saw there written, "Put off the
old man with his deeds."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> And how then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Then it came burning hot into my mind,
whatever he said, and however he flattered, when
he got home to his house he would sell me for a
slave. So I bid him forbear, for I would not come
near the door of his house. Then he reviled me,
and told me that he would send such a one after
me that should make my way bitter to my soul.
So I turned to go away from him; but, just as I
turned myself to go thence, I felt him take hold of
my flesh, and give me such a deadly twitch back,
that I thought he had pulled part of me after
himself: this made me cry, "O wretched man!"
So I went on my way up the hill. Now, when I
had got about half-way up, I looked behind me,
and saw one coming after me, swift as the wind;
so he overtook me just about the place where the
settle stands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "Just there," said Christian, "did I sit
down to rest me; but being overcome with sleep,
I there lost this roll out of my bosom."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> But, good brother, hear me out. So
soon as the man overtook me, he was but a word
and a blow; for down he knocked me, and laid me
for dead. But, when I was a little come to myself
again, I asked him wherefore he served me so.
He said, because of my secret inclining to Adam
the First. And, with that, he struck me another
deadly blow on the breast, and beat me down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
backwards; so I lay at his feet as dead as before.
So, when I came to myself again, I cried him
mercy; but he said, "I know not how to show
mercy;" and, with that, he knocked me down
again. He had doubtless made an end of me, but
that One came by, and bid him forbear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Who was that that bid him forbear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> I did not know him at first; but, as He
went by, I perceived the holes in His hands and
His side; then I concluded that He was our Lord.
So I went up the hill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> That man that overtook you was Moses.
He spareth none, neither knoweth he how to show
mercy to those that disobey his law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> I know it very well: it was not the first
time that he has met with me. It was he that
came to me when I dwelt securely at home, and
that told me he would burn my house over my
head if I stayed there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> But did not you see the house that
stood there, on the top of that hill on the side of
which Moses met you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Yes, and the lions too, before I came
at it. But, for the lions, I think they were asleep,
for it was about noon; and because I had so much
of the day before me I passed by the Porter, and
came down the hill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> He told me, indeed, that he saw you go
by; but I wished you had called at the house, for
they would have showed you so many rarities,
that you would scarce have forgot them to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
day of your death. But pray tell me, did you
meet nobody in the Valley of Humility?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Yes, I met with one Discontent, who
would willingly have persuaded me to go back
again with him: his reason was, for that the
valley was altogether without honor. He told
me, moreover, that there to go was the way to
disoblige all my friends, as Pride, Arrogancy, Self-Conceit,
Worldly-Glory, with others, who he knew,
as he said, would be very much offended if I made
such a fool of myself as to wade through this
valley.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Well, and how did you answer him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> I told him that, although all these that
he named might claim kindred of me, and that
rightly (for, indeed, they were my relations according
to the flesh), yet, since I became a pilgrim,
they have disowned me, as I also have rejected
them; and therefore they were to me now no
more than if they had never been of my lineage.
I told him, moreover, that as to this valley, he had
quite misrepresented the thing; for before honor
is humility, and a haughty spirit before a fall.
"Therefore," said I, "I had rather go through this
valley to the honor that was so accounted by the
wisest, than choose that which he esteemed most
worthy of our affections."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Met you with nothing else in that
valley?</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHAME A BOLD VILLAIN</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Yes, I met with Shame; but, of all the
men that I met with in my pilgrimage, he I think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
bears the wrong name. The others would take
"No" for an answer, at least after some words of
denial; but this bold-faced Shame would never
have done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Why, what did he say to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> What? why, he objected against religion
itself. He said it was a pitiful, low, sneaking
business for a man to mind religion. He said
that a tender conscience was an unmanly thing;
and that for a man to watch over his words and
ways, so as to tie up himself from that liberty that
the brave spirits of the times accustom themselves
unto, would make him the ridicule of all the people
in our time. He objected also, that but a few of
the mighty, rich, or wise were ever of my opinion;
nor any of them neither, before they were persuaded
to be fools, to venture the loss of all for
nobody else knows what. He, moreover, objected
the base and low estate and condition of
those that were chiefly the pilgrims of the times
in which they lived; also their ignorance, and
want of understanding in all worldly knowledge.
Yea, he did hold me to it at that rate also, about
a great many more things than here I relate; as,
that it was a shame to sit whining and mourning
under a sermon, and a shame to come sighing and
groaning home; that it was a shame to ask my
neighbor forgiveness for petty faults, or to give
back what I had taken from any. He said also
that religion made a man grow strange to the
great, because of a few vices (which he called by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
finer names), and because religion made him own
and respect the base, who were of the same
religious company; "and is not this," said he,
"a shame?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> And what did you say to him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Say? I could not tell what to say at
first. Yea, he put me so to it that my blood came
up in my face; even this Shame fetched it up, and
had almost beat me quite off. But at last I began
to consider that that which is highly esteemed
among men is had in abomination with God.
And I thought again, This Shame tells me what
men are, but it tells me nothing what God, or the
Word of God is. And I thought, moreover, that
at the day of doom we shall not be doomed to
death or life according to the spirits of the world,
but according to the wisdom and law of the
Highest. Therefore, thought I, what God says is
best&mdash;is best, though all the men in the world are
against it. Seeing, then, that God prefers His
religion; seeing God prefers a tender conscience;
seeing they that make themselves fools for the
kingdom of heaven are wisest, and that the poor
man that loveth Christ is richer than the greatest
man in the world that hates Him; Shame, depart!
thou art an enemy to my salvation. Shall I listen
to thee against my sovereign Lord? how, then,
shall I look Him in the face at His coming?
Should I now be ashamed of His way and servants
how can I expect the blessing? But, indeed, this
Shame was a bold villain: I could scarce shake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
him out of my company; yea, he would be haunting
of me, and continually whispering me in the
ear with some one or other of the weak things that
attend religion. But at last I told him it was in
vain to attempt further in this business; for those
things that he despised, in those did I see most
glory; and so, at last, I got past this persistent
one. And when I had shaken him off, then I
began to sing,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The trials that those men do meet withal,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That are obedient to the heavenly call,</span><br />

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I am glad, my brother, that thou didst
withstand this villain so bravely: for of all, as
thou sayest, I think he has the wrong name; for
he is so bold as to follow us in the streets, and to
attempt to put us to shame before all men; that
is, to make us ashamed of that which is good.
But, if he was not himself bold, he would never
attempt to do as he does. But let us still resist
him; for, notwithstanding all his bold words, he
promoteth the fool, and none else. "The wise
shall inherit glory," said Solomon; "but shame
shall be the promotion of fools."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> I think we must cry to Him for help
against Shame who would have us to be valiant
for truth upon the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> You say true. But did you meet
nobody else in that valley?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> No, not I; for I had sunshine all the
rest of the way through that, and also through
the Valley of the Shadow of Death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> It was well for you! I am sure it
fared far otherwise with me. I had for a long
season, as soon almost as I entered into that
valley, a dreadful combat with that foul fiend
Apollyon; yea, I thought verily he would have
killed me, especially when he got me down,
and crushed me under him, as if he would have
crushed me to pieces. For, as he threw me,
my sword flew out of my hand; nay, he told
me he was sure of me; and I cried to God, and
He heard me, and delivered me out of all my
troubles. Then I entered into the Valley of the
Shadow of Death, and had no light for almost
half the way through it. I thought I should
have been killed there over and over: but at
last day broke, and the sun rose, and I went
through that which was behind with far more
ease and quiet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TALKATIVE OVERTAKEN</div>

<p>Moreover, I saw in my dream that, as they went
on, Faithful, as he chanced to look on one side,
saw a man whose name is Talkative walking at a
distance beside them; for in this place there was
room enough for them all to walk. He was a tall
man, and something better looking at a distance
than near at hand. To this man Faithful spoke
himself in this manner:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Friend, whither away? Are you going
to the heavenly country?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> I am going to that same place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> That is well; then I hope we may have
your good company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> With a very good will, will I be your
companion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Come on, then, and let us go together,
and let us spend our time in talking of things that
are profitable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> To talk of things that are good, to me
is very acceptable, with you or with any other;
and I am glad that I have met with those that
incline to so good a work; for, to speak the truth,
there are but few who care thus to spend their time
as they are in their travels, but choose much
rather to be speaking of things to no profit; and
this has been a trouble to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> That is, indeed, a thing to be lamented;
for what things so worthy of the use of the tongue
and mouth of men on earth, as are the things of the
God of heaven?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> I like you wonderfully well, for your
saying is full of the truth; and I will add, What
thing is so pleasant, and what so profitable, as to
talk of the things of God? What things so pleasant?
that is, if a man hath any delight in things
that are wonderful. For instance, if a man doth
delight to talk of the history or the mystery of
things, or if a man doth love to talk of miracles,
wonders, or signs, where shall he find things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
written so delightful, or so sweetly penned, as in
the Holy Scripture?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> That's true; but to be profited by such
things in our talk should be that which we design.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TALKATIVE SELF-DECEIVED</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> That is it that I said; for to talk of such
things is most profitable; for, by so doing, a man
may get knowledge of many things; as of the
folly of earthly things, and the benefit of things
above. Besides, by this a man may learn what
it is to turn from sin, to believe, to pray, to suffer,
or the like; by this, also, a man may learn what
are the great promises and comforts of the Gospel,
to his own enjoyment. Further, by this a man
may learn to answer false opinions, to prove the
truth, and also to teach the ignorant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> All this is true; and glad am I to hear
these things from you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> Alas! the want of this is the cause that
so few understand the need of faith, and the
necessity of a work of grace in their soul, in order
to eternal life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> But, by your leave, heavenly knowledge
of these is the gift of God; no man attaineth to them
by human working, or only by the talk of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> All that I know very well, for a man can
receive nothing except it be given him from
heaven; I could give you a hundred scriptures
for the confirmation of this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> "Well, then," said Faithful, "what is
that one thing that we shall at this time found
our talk upon?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> What you will. I will talk of things
heavenly or things earthly; things in life or things
in the gospel; things sacred or things worldly;
things past or things to come; things foreign or
things at home; things necessary or things accidental,
provided that all be done to our profit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Now did Faithful begin to wonder;
and, stepping to Christian (for he walked all this
while by himself), he said to him, but softly,
"What a brave companion have we got! Surely
this man will make a very excellent pilgrim."</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAITHFUL DISPUTES TALKATIVE</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> At this Christian modestly smiled, and
said, "This man with whom you are so taken will
deceive with this tongue of his twenty of them
that know him not."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Do you know him, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Know him? Yes, better than he knows
himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Pray what is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> His name is Talkative; he dwelleth in
our town. I wonder that you should be a
stranger to him: only I consider that our town
is large.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Whose son is he? and whereabout doth
he dwell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> He is the son of one Say-well. He dwelt
in Prating Row, and is known to all that are
acquainted with him by the name of Talkative
of Prating Row; and notwithstanding his fine
tongue, he is but a sorry fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Well, he seems to be a very pretty man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> That is, to them that have not a thorough
acquaintance with him, for he is best abroad; near
home he is ugly enough. Your saying that he is a
pretty man brings to my mind what I have observed
in the work of the painter, whose pictures show best
at a distance, but very near more unpleasing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> But I am ready to think you do but
jest, because you smiled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> God forbid that I should jest (though
I smiled) in this matter, or that I should accuse
any falsely. I will give you a further discovery
of him. This man is for any company, and for
any talk. As he talketh now with you, so will he
talk when he is on the ale-bench; and the more
drink he hath in his crown, the more of these
things he hath in his mouth. Religion hath no
place in his heart, or house, or conversation: all
he hath lieth in his tongue, and his religion is to
make a noise therewith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Say you so? Then am I in this man
greatly deceived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Deceived! you may be sure of it. Remember
the proverb, "They say, and do not;"
but the kingdom of God is not in word, but in
power. He talketh of prayer, of turning to God,
of faith, and of the new birth; but he knows but
only to talk of them. I have been in his family,
and have seen him both at home and abroad, and
I know what I say of him is the truth. His house
is as empty of religion as the white of an egg is of
savor. There is there neither prayer nor sign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
turning from sin; yea, the brute, in his kind,
serves God far better than he. He is the very
stain, reproach, and shame of religion to all that
know him. It can hardly have a good word in all
that end of the town where he dwells, through
him. Thus say the common people that know
him: "A saint abroad, and a devil at home."
His poor family finds it so: he is such a fault-finder,
such a railer at, and so unreasonable with
his servants, that they neither know how to do for
or speak to him. Men that have any dealings
with him say, it is better to deal with a Turk than
with him, for fairer dealing they shall have at
their hands. This Talkative, if it be possible, will
go beyond them, cheat, beguile, and overreach
them. Besides, he brings up his sons to follow
his steps; and, if he findeth in any of them a
foolish timorousness (for so he calls the first
appearance of a tender conscience), he calls them
fools and blockheads, and by no means will
employ them in much, or speak to their commendation
before others. For my part, I am of
opinion that he has, by his wicked life, caused
many to stumble and fall, and will be, if God prevent
not, the ruin of many more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Well, my brother, I am bound to
believe you, not only because you say you know
him, but also because like a Christian you make
your reports of men. For I cannot think you
speak these things of ill-will, but because it is
even so as you say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Had I known him no more than you, I
might, perhaps, have thought of him as at first
you did; yea, had he received this report only from
those that are enemies to religion, I should have
thought it had been a slander, a lot that often
falls from bad men's mouths upon good men's
names and professions. But all these things, yea,
and a great many more as bad, of my own knowledge
I can prove him guilty of. Besides, good
men are ashamed of him: they can neither call
him brother nor friend; the very naming of him
among them makes them blush, if they know him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Well, I see that saying and doing are
two things, and hereafter I shall better observe
the difference between them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> They are two things, indeed, and are as
diverse as are the soul and the body; for, as the
body without the soul is but a dead carcase, so
<i>saying</i>, if it be alone, is but a dead carcase also.
The soul of religion is the practical part. "Pure
religion and undefiled before God and the Father
is this, to visit the fatherless and the widows in
their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted
from the world." This, Talkative is not aware
of: he thinks that hearing and saying will make
a good Christian, and thus he deceiveth his own
soul. Hearing is but as the sowing of the seed;
talking is not sufficient to prove that fruit is
indeed in the heart and life. And let us assure
ourselves that, at the day of doom, men shall be
judged according to their fruits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Well, I was not so fond of his company
at first, but I am as sick of it now. What shall
we do to be rid of him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Take my advice, and do as I bid you,
and you shall find that he will soon be sick of your
company too, except God shall touch his heart
and turn it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> What would you have me to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Why, go to him, and enter into some
serious conversation about the power of religion
and ask him plainly (when he has approved of it,
for that he will) whether this thing be set up in
his heart, house or conduct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Then Faithful stepped forward again,
and said to Talkative, "Come, what cheer? How
is it now?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> Thank you, well: I thought we should
have had a great deal of talk by this time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Well, if you will, we will fall to it now;
and, since you left it with me to state the question,
let it be this: How doth the saving grace of God
show itself when it is in the heart of man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> I perceive, then, that our talk must be
about the power of things. Well, it is a very
good question, and I shall be willing to answer
you. And take my answer in brief, thus. First,
where the grace of God is in the heart, it causeth
there a great outcry against sin. Secondly,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Nay, hold; let us consider of one at
once. I think you should rather say, it shows
itself by inclining the soul to hate its sin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> Why, what difference is there between
crying out against and hating sin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Oh! a great deal. A man may cry out
against sin in order to appear good; but he cannot
hate it except by a real dislike for it. I have
heard many cry out against sin in the pulpit, who
yet can abide it well enough in the heart, house,
and life. Some cry out against sin, even as the
mother cries out against her child in her lap,
when she calleth it a naughty girl, and then falls
to hugging and kissing it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> You are trying to catch me, I perceive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> No, not I; I am only for setting things
right. But what is the second thing whereby
you would prove a discovery of a work of God in
the heart?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> Great knowledge of hard things in the
Bible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TALKATIVE PARTS COMPANY</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> This sign should have been first; but,
first or last, it is also false; for knowledge, great
knowledge, may be obtained in the mysteries of
the Gospel, and yet no work of grace in the soul.
Yea, if a man have all knowledge, he may yet be
nothing, and so, consequently, be no child of God.
When Christ said, "Do ye know all these things?"
and the disciples had answered, "Yes," He added,
"Blessed are ye if ye do them." He doth not lay
the blessing in the knowledge of them, but in the
doing of them. For there is a knowledge that is
not attended with doing: "He that knoweth his
master's will, and doeth it not." A man may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
know like an angel, and yet be no Christian;
therefore your sign of it is not true. Indeed, to
know, is a thing that pleaseth talkers and boasters;
but to do is that which pleaseth God.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> You are trying to catch me again: this
is not profitable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Well, if you please, name another sign
how this work of grace showeth itself where it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> Not I; for I see we shall not agree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Well, if you will not, will you give me
leave to do it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> You may say what you please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> God's work in the soul showeth itself
either to him that hath it or to standers by. To
him that has it, it is shown by making him see
and feel his own sins. To others who are standing
by it is shown by his life, a life of doing right in
the sight of God. And now, sir, as to this brief
account of the work of grace, and also the showing
of it, if you have aught to object, object; if
not, then give me leave to ask you a second
question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> Nay, my part is not now to object, but
to hear; let me, therefore, have your second
question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> It is this: Have you felt your own sins,
and have you turned from them? And do your
life and conduct show it the same? Or is your
religion in word or in tongue, and not in deed and
truth? Pray, if you incline to answer me in this,
say no more than you know the God above will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
say Amen to, and also nothing but what your
conscience can approve you in; for not he that
commendeth himself is approved, but whom the
Lord commendeth. Besides, to say I am thus
and thus, when my conduct and all my neighbors
tell me I lie, is great wickedness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> Then Talkative at first began to blush;
but, recovering himself, thus he replied: "This
kind of discourse I did not expect; nor am I disposed
to give an answer to such questions, because
I count not myself bound thereto, unless you take
upon you to be a questioner; and though you
should do so, yet I may refuse to make you my
judge. But, I pray, will you tell me why you ask
me such questions?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Because I saw you forward to talk, and
because I knew not that you had aught else but
notion. Besides, to tell you all the truth, I have
heard of you that you are a man whose religion
lies in talk, and that your life gives this your
mouth-profession the lie. They say you are a
spot among Christians, and that religion fareth
the worse for your ungodly conduct; that some
already have stumbled at your wicked ways, and
that more are in danger of being destroyed thereby:
your religion, and an alehouse, and greed for
gain, and uncleanness, and swearing, and lying,
and vain company-keeping, etc., will stand
together. You are a shame to all who are members
of the church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Talk.</span> Since you are ready to take up reports,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and to judge so rashly as you do, I cannot but
conclude you are some peevish or cross man, not
fit to be talked with; and so adieu.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then came up Christian, and said to
his brother, "I told you how it would happen;
your words and his heart could not agree. He
had rather leave your company than reform his
life. But he is gone, as I said: let him go; the
loss is no man's but his own: he has saved us the
trouble of going from him; for he continuing (as
I suppose he will do) as he is, he would have been
but a blot in our company. Besides, the Apostle
says, 'From such withdraw thyself.'"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> But I am glad we had this little talk
with him; it may happen that he will think of it
again: however, I have dealt plainly with him,
and so am clear of his blood, if he perisheth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> You did well to talk so plainly to him
as you did. There is but little of this faithful
dealing with men now-a-days; and that makes
religion to be despised by so many; for they are
these talkative fools, whose religion is only in
word, and are vile and vain in their life, that,
being so much admitted into the fellowship of
the godly, do puzzle the world, blemish Christianity,
and grieve the sincere. I wish that all
men would deal with such as you have done; then
should they either be made more suitable to
religion, or the company of saints would be too
hot for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> Then did Faithful say,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"How Talkative at first lifts up his plumes!</span><br />
<span class="i0">How bravely doth he speak! How he presumes</span><br />
<span class="i0">To drive down all before him! But so soon</span><br />
<span class="i0">As Faithful talks of heart-work, like the moon</span><br />
<span class="i0">That's past the full, into the wane he goes;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And so will all but he who heart-work knows."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Thus they went on, talking of what they had
seen by the way, and so made that way easy,
which would otherwise, no doubt, have been
tedious to them; for now they went through a
wilderness.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>Now, when they were got almost quite out
of this wilderness, Faithful chanced to
cast his eye back, and espied one coming
after him, and he knew him. "Oh!" said
Faithful to his brother, "who comes yonder?"
Then Christian looked, and said, "It is my good
friend Evangelist." "Ay, and my good friend,
too," said Faithful; "for it was he that set me
the way to the gate." Now was Evangelist come
up unto them, and thus saluted them:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evan.</span> Peace be with you, dearly beloved, and
peace be to your helpers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Welcome, welcome, my good Evangelist:
the sight of thy face brings to my thought
thy former kindness and unwearied laboring for
my eternal good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> "And a thousand times welcome," said
good Faithful: "thy company, O sweet Evangelist,
how desirable is it to us poor pilgrims!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evan.</span> Then said Evangelist, "How hath it
fared with you, my friends, since the time of our
last parting? What have you met with, and how
have you behaved yourselves?"</p>

<p>Then Christian and Faithful told him of all
things that had happened to them in the way;
and how, and with what difficulty, they had
arrived to that place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span><span class="smcap">Evan.</span> "Right glad am I," said Evangelist,
"not that you met with trials, but that you have
been victors, and for that you have, notwithstanding
many weaknesses, continued in the way
to this very day. I say, right glad am I of this
thing, and that for my own sake and yours.
I have sowed, and you have reaped; and the day
is coming when 'both he that sowed and they that
reaped shall rejoice together;' that is, if you faint
not. The crown is before you, and it is an uncorruptible
one: so run that you may obtain it.
Some there be that set out for this crown, and
after they have gone far for it, another comes in
and takes it from them: 'Hold fast, therefore,
that you have; let no man take your crown.'"</p>

<p>Then Christian thanked him for his words, but
told him withal that they would have him speak
further to them, for their help the rest of the way;
and the rather, for that they well knew that he
was a prophet, and could tell them of things that
might happen unto them, and also how they might
resist and overcome them. To which request
Faithful also consented. So Evangelist began
as followeth:</p>

<div class="sidenote">EVANGELIST EXHORTS CHRISTIAN</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Evan.</span> My sons, you have heard, in the words
of the truth of the Gospel, that you must "through
many trials enter into the kingdom of heaven;"
and again, that "in every city bonds and afflictions
await you;" and therefore you cannot expect
that you should go long on your pilgrimage without
them in some sort or other. You have found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
something of the truth of these words upon you
already, and more will immediately follow; for
now, as you see, you are almost out of this wilderness,
and therefore you will soon come into a
town that you will by-and-by see before you; and
in that town you will be hardly beset with enemies
who will strain hard but they will kill you; and be
you sure that one or both of you must seal the
truth which you hold with blood: but be you
faithful unto death, and the King will give you a
crown of life. He that shall die there, although
his death will be unnatural, and his pain, perhaps,
great, he will yet have the better of his fellow;
not only because he will be arrived at the Celestial
City soonest, but because he will escape many
miseries that the other will meet with in the rest of
his journey. But when you are come to the town,
and shall find fulfilled what I have here related,
then remember your friend, and quit yourselves
like men, and commit the keeping of your souls to
God in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PILGRIMS AT VANITY FAIR</div>

<p>Then I saw in my dream, that, when they were
got out of the wilderness, they presently saw a
town before them, and the name of that town is
Vanity; and at the town there is a fair kept,
called Vanity Fair. It is kept all the year long.
It beareth the name of Vanity Fair, because the
town where it is kept is lighter than vanity, and
also because all that is there sold, or that cometh
thither, is vanity; as is the saying of the Wise,
"All that cometh is vanity."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>This is no newly begun business, but a thing of
ancient standing. I will show you the original
of it.</p>

<p>Almost five thousand years ago, there were
pilgrims walking to the Celestial City, as these
two honest persons are; and Beelzebub, Apollyon,
and Legion, with their companions, perceiving by
the path that the pilgrims made that their way
to the city lay through this town of Vanity, they
contrived here to set up a fair; a fair wherein
should be sold all sorts of vanity, and that it
should last all the year long. Therefore at this
fair are all such things sold as houses, lands,
trades, places, honors, preferments, titles, countries,
kingdoms, lusts, pleasures, and delights of
all sorts, as wives, husbands, children, masters,
servants, lives, blood, bodies, souls, silver, gold,
pearls, precious stones, and what not.</p>

<p>And, moreover, at this fair there are at all
times to be seen jugglings, cheats, games, plays,
fools, apes, knaves, and rogues, and that of every
kind.</p>

<p>Here are to be seen, too, and that for nothing,
thefts, murders, false swearers, and that of a
blood-red color.</p>

<p>And, as in other fairs of less moment there are
several rows and streets under their proper names,
where such and such wares are vended; so here
likewise you have the proper places, rows, streets
(namely, countries and kingdoms), where the wares
of this fair are soonest to be found. Here are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Britain Row, the French Row, the Italian Row,
the Spanish Row, the German Row, where several
sorts of vanities are to be sold. But, as in other
fairs some one commodity is as the chief of all the
fair, so the ware of Rome and her goods are
greatly promoted in this fair; only our English
nation, with some others, have taken dislike
thereat.</p>

<p>Now, as I said, the way to the Celestial City lies
just through this town where this lusty fair is
kept; and he that would go to the city, and yet
not go through this town, "must needs go out of
the world." The Prince of princes Himself, when
here, went through this town to His own country,
and that upon a fair day too; yea, and as I think,
it was Beelzebub, the chief lord of this fair, that
invited Him to buy of his vanities; yea, would
have made Him lord of the fair, would He but
have done him reverence as He went through the
town. Yea, because He was such a person of
honor, Beelzebub had Him from street to street,
and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in
a little time, that he might, if possible, allure that
Blessed One to ask for and buy some of his
vanities; but He had no mind to the merchandise,
and therefore left the town without laying out so
much as one farthing upon these vanities. This
fair, therefore, is an ancient thing of long-standing,
and a very great fair.</p>

<p>Now, these pilgrims, as I said, must needs go
through this fair. Well, so they did; but, behold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
even as they entered into the fair, all the people
in the fair were moved and the town itself, as it
were, in a hubbub about them, and that for
several reasons; for,</p>

<p>First,&mdash;The pilgrims were clothed with such
kind of garments as were different from the
raiment of any that traded in that fair. The
people, therefore, of the fair, made a great gazing
upon them: some said they were fools; some,
they were bedlams; and some, they were outlandish
men.</p>

<p>Secondly,&mdash;And, as they wondered at their
apparel, so they did likewise at their speech; for
few could understand what they said. They
naturally spoke the language of Canaan; but they
that kept the fair were the men of this world. So
that from one end of the fair to the other, they
seemed barbarians each to the other.</p>

<p>Thirdly,&mdash;But that which did not a little amuse
the store-keepers was, that these pilgrims set very
light by all their wares. They cared not so much
as to look upon them; and if they called upon
them to buy, they would put their fingers in their
ears, and cry, "Turn away mine eyes from
beholding vanity," and look upwards, signifying
that their trade and traffic were in heaven.</p>

<p>One chanced, mockingly, beholding the actions
of the men, to say unto them, "What will you
buy?" But they, looking gravely upon him,
said, "We buy the truth." At that there was an
occasion taken to despise the men the more: some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
mocking, some taunting, some speaking reproachfully,
and some calling on others to smite them.
At last things came to a hubbub and great stir in
the fair, insomuch that all order was confounded.
Now was word presently brought to the great one
of the fair, who quickly came down, and deputed
some of his most trusty friends to take these men
for trial about whom the fair was almost overturned.
So the men were brought to trial, and
they that sat upon them asked them whence they
came, whither they went, and what they did
there in such an unusual garb. The men told
them that they were pilgrims and strangers in
the world, and that they were going to their own
country, which was the heavenly Jerusalem, and
that they had given no occasion to the men of the
town, nor yet to the merchants, thus to abuse
them, and to hinder them in their journey, except
it was for that, when one asked them what they
would buy, they said they would buy the truth.
But they that were appointed to examine them
did not believe them to be any other than crazy
people and mad, or else such as came to put all
things into a confusion in the fair. Therefore
they took them and beat them, and besmeared
them with dirt, and then put them into the cage,
that they might be made a spectacle to all the
men of the fair. There, therefore, they lay for
some time, and were made the objects of any
man's sport, or malice, or revenge; the great one
of the fair laughing still at all that befell them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
But, the men being patient, and "not rendering
railing for railing, but contrariwise blessing," and
giving good words for bad, and kindness for
injuries done, some men in the fair that were more
observing and less opposed than the rest, began
to check and blame the baser sort for their continual
abuses done by them to the men. They,
therefore, in an angry manner, let fly at them
again, counting them as bad as the men in the
cage, and telling them that they seemed to be in
league with them, and should be made partakers
of their misfortunes. The others replied, that,
for aught they could see, the men were quiet and
sober, and intended nobody any harm; and that
there were many that traded in their fair that were
more worthy to be put into the cage, yea, and
pillory too, than were the men that they had
abused. Thus, after divers words had passed on
both sides (the men behaving themselves all the
while very wisely and soberly before them,) they
fell to some blows, and did harm to one another.
Then were these two poor men brought before the
court again, and there charged as being guilty of
the late hubbub that had been in the fair. So
they beat them pitifully, and hanged irons upon
them, and led them in chains up and down the
fair, for an example and terror to others, lest any
should speak in their behalf, or join themselves
unto them. But Christian and Faithful behaved
themselves yet more wisely, and received the
wrongs and shame that were cast upon them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
so much meekness and patience, that it won to
their side (though but few in comparison of the
rest) several of the men in the fair. This put the
other party in yet a greater rage, insomuch that
they resolved upon the death of these two men.
Wherefore they threatened that neither cage nor
irons should serve their turn, but that they should
die for the abuse they had done, and for deceiving
the men of the fair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PILGRIMS IN STOCKS</div>

<p>Then were they remanded to the cage again,
until further order should be taken with them.
So they put them in, and made their feet fast in
the stocks.</p>

<p>Here, therefore, they called again to mind what
they had heard from their faithful friend Evangelist,
and were more confirmed in their way and
sufferings, by what he told them would happen to
them. They also now comforted each other,
that whose lot it was to suffer, even he should
have the best of it; therefore each man secretly
wished he might have that privilege. But, committing
themselves to the all-wise disposal of
Him that ruleth all things, with much content
they abode in the condition in which they were,
until they should be otherwise disposed of.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD HATE-GOOD</div>

<p>Then a convenient time being appointed, they
brought them forth to their trial, in order to their
being condemned. When the time was come,
they were brought before their enemies, and
placed on trial. The judge's name was Lord
Hate-good: the charges against both were one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and the same in substance, though somewhat
varying in form; the contents whereof were this:
"That they were enemies to and disturbers of
their trade; that they had made riots and divisions
in the town, and had won a party to their
own most dangerous opinions, in contempt of the
law of their prince."</p>

<p>Then Faithful began to answer, that he had
only set himself against that which had set itself
against Him that is higher than the highest.
"And," said he, "as for disturbances, I make none,
being myself a man of peace; the parties that were
won to us, were won by beholding our truth and
innocence, and they are only turned from the
worse to the better. And, as to the king you talk
of, since he is Beelzebub, the enemy of our Lord,
I defy him and all his angels."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PILGRIMS ON TRIAL</div>

<p>Then it was made known that they that had
aught to say for their lord the king against the
prisoner at the bar should forthwith appear and
give in their evidence. So there came in three
witnesses; to wit, Envy, Superstition, and Pickthank.
They were then asked if they knew the
prisoner at the bar, and what they had to say for
their lord the king against him.</p>

<p>Then stood forth Envy, and said to this effect:
"My lord, I have known this man a long time,
and will attest upon my oath before this honorable
bench that he is&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge.</span> Hold! Give him his oath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Envy.</span> So they sware him. Then said he, "My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
lord, this man, notwithstanding his name, Faithful
is one of the vilest men in our country. He cares
for neither prince nor people, law nor custom,
but doth all that he can to possess all men with
certain of his disloyal notions, which he in the
general calls principles of faith and holiness. And
in particular, I heard him once myself affirm that
Christianity and the customs of our town of Vanity
were opposite, and could not be reconciled. By
which saying, my lord, he doth at once not only
condemn all our laudable doings, but us in the
doing of them."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge.</span> Then did the judge say to him, "Hast
thou any more to say?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Envy.</span> My lord, I could say much more, only I
would not be tiresome to the court. Yet, if need
be, when the other gentlemen have given in their
evidence, rather than anything shall be wanting
that will dispatch him, I will have more to speak
against him. So he was bid stand by.</p>

<p>Then they called Superstition, and bade him
look upon the prisoner. They also asked what he
could say for their lord the king against him.
Then they sware him: so he began:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Super.</span> My lord, I have no great acquaintance
with this man, nor do I desire to have further
knowledge of him. However, this I know, that
he is a very pestilent fellow, from some discourse
the other day that I had with him in this town;
for then, talking with him, I heard him say that
our religion was naught, and such by which a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
could by no means please God. Which saying of
his, my lord, your lordship very well knows what
necessarily thence will follow; to wit, that we
still do worship in vain, are yet in our sins, and
finally shall be destroyed: and this is that which
I have to say.</p>

<p>Then was Pickthank sworn, and bid say what
he knew, in behalf of their lord the king, against
the prisoner at the bar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pick.</span> My lord, and you gentlemen all, this
fellow I have known a long time, and have heard
him speak things that ought not to be spoken,
for he hath railed on our noble prince Beelzebub,
and hath spoken contemptuously of his honorable
friends, whose names are, the Lord Old-man, the
Lord Carnal-Delight, the Lord Luxurious, the
Lord Desire-of-Vain-Glory, my old Lord Lust,
Sir Having Greedy, with all the rest of our nobility
and he hath said, moreover, that, if all men were
of his mind, if possible there is not one of these
noblemen should have any longer a being in this
town. Besides, he has not been afraid to rail on
you, my lord, who are now appointed to be his
judge, calling you an ungodly villain, with many
other such-like abusive terms, with which he hath
bespattered most of the gentry of our town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge.</span> When this Pickthank had told his tale,
the judge directed his speech to the prisoner at
the bar, saying, "Thou runagate, heretic, and
traitor! hast thou heard what these honest gentlemen
have witnessed against thee?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> May I speak a few words in my own
defense?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge.</span> Sirrah, sirrah, thou deservest to live no
longer, but to be slain immediately upon the
place; yet, that all men may see our gentleness
towards thee, let us hear what thou, vile runagate,
hast to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> 1. I say, then, in answer to what Mr.
Envy hath spoken, I have never said aught but
this, that what rule, or laws, or custom, or people
were flat against the Word of God, are opposite
to Christianity. If I have said amiss in this,
convince me of my error, and I am ready here
before you to take back my words.</p>

<p>2. As to the second, to wit, Mr. Superstition
and his charge against me, I said only this, that in
the worship of God there is required true faith.
But there can be no true faith without a knowledge
of the will of God. Therefore, whatever is
thrust into the worship of God that is not agreeable
to the word of God will not profit to eternal life.</p>

<p>3. As to what Mr. Pickthank hath said, I say
(avoiding terms, as that I am said to rail, and the
like), that the prince of this town, with all the
rabblement his attendants, by this gentleman
named, are more fit for a being in hell than in this
town and country. And so the Lord have mercy
upon me!</p>

<p>Then the judge called to the jury (who all this
while stood by to hear and observe), "Gentlemen
of the jury, you see this man about whom so great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
an uproar hath been made in this town; you have
also heard what these worthy gentlemen have
witnessed against him; also you have heard his
reply and confession. It lieth now in your
breast to hang him or to save his life; but yet I
think meet to instruct you into our law.</p>

<p>"There was an act made in the days of Pharaoh,
the great servant to our prince, that, lest those of
a contrary religion should multiply and grow
too strong for him, their males should be thrown
into the river. There was also an act made in
the days of Nebuchadnezzar the Great, another
of his servants, that whoever would not fall down
and worship his golden image should be thrown
into a fiery furnace. There was also an act made
in the days of Darius, that whoso for some time
called upon any god but him should be cast into
the lions' den. Now, the substance of these laws
this rebel has broken, not only in thought (which
is not to be borne,) but also in word and deed,
which must, therefore, needs be intolerable. You
see he disputeth against our religion; and for the
reason that he hath confessed he deserveth to die
the death."</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAITHFUL DIES AT THE STAKE</div>

<p>Then went the jury out, whose names were Mr.
Blind-man, Mr. No-good, Mr. Malice, Mr. Love-lust,
Mr. Live-loose, Mr. Heady, Mr. High-mind,
Mr. Enmity, Mr. Liar, Mr. Cruelty, Mr. Hate-light,
and Mr. Implacable, who every one gave in
his private voice against him among themselves,
and afterwards unanimously concluded to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
him in guilty before the Judge. And first among
themselves, Mr. Blind-man, the foreman, said,
"I see clearly that this man is a heretic." Then
said Mr. No-good, "Away with such a fellow from
the earth!" "Ay," said Mr. Malice, "for I hate
the very look of him." Then said Mr. Love-lust,
"I could never endure him." "Nor I," said Mr.
Live-loose; "for he would always be condemning
my way." "Hang him, hang him!" said Mr.
Heady. "A sorry scrub," said Mr. High-mind.
"My heart riseth against him," said Mr. Enmity.
"He is a rogue," said Mr. Liar. "Hanging is too
good for him," said Mr. Cruelty. "Let us dispatch
him out of the way," said Mr. Hate-light.
Then said Mr. Implacable, "Might I have all the
world given to me, I could not be reconciled to
him; therefore let us forthwith bring him in guilty
of death."</p>

<p>And so they did: therefore he was presently
condemned to be had from the place where he was,
to the place from whence he came, and there to be
put to the most cruel death that could be invented.</p>

<p>They therefore brought him out, to do with
him according to their law; and first they scourged
him, then they buffeted him, then they lanced his
flesh with knives; after that they stoned him with
stones, then pricked him with their swords, and,
last of all, they burned him to ashes at the stake.
Thus came Faithful to his end.</p>

<p>Now, I saw that there stood behind the multitude
a chariot and a couple of horses waiting for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Faithful, who (so soon as his enemies had slain
him) was taken up into it, and straightway was
carried up through the clouds with sound of
trumpet the nearest way to the Celestial Gate.
But as for Christian, he had some delay, and was
sent back to prison; so he there remained for a
space. But He who overrules all things, having
the power of their rage in his own hand, so
wrought it about that Christian for that time
escaped them, and went his way. And as he
went, he sang, saying,</p>

<div class="poem">

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>Now, I saw in my dream, that Christian
went forth not alone; for there was one
whose name was Hopeful (being so
made by looking upon Christian and Faithful in
their words and behavior in their sufferings at the
fair,) who joined himself unto him, and, entering
into a brotherly pledge told him that he would be
his companion. Thus one died to show faithfulness
to the truth, and another rises out of his
ashes to be a companion with Christian in his
pilgrimage. This Hopeful also told Christian that
there were many more of the men in the fair that
would take their time and follow after.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BY-ENDS OF FAIR-SPEECH</div>

<p>So I saw that, quickly after they were got out
of the fair, they overtook one that was going
before them, whose name was By-ends; so they
said to him, "What countryman, sir? and how far
go you this way?" He told them that he came
from the town of Fair-speech, and he was going
to the Celestial City; but told them not his name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "From Fair-speech! are there any that
be good live there?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By.</span> "Yes," said By-ends, "I hope."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Pray, sir, what may I call you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By.</span> I am a stranger to you, and you to me:
if you be going this way, I shall be glad of your
company; if not, I must be content.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> This town of Fair-speech, I have heard
of it; and, as I remember, they say it's a wealthy
place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By.</span> Yes, I will assure you that it is; and I
have very many rich kindred there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Pray, who are your kindred there? if a
man may be so bold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By.</span> Almost the whole town; but in particular
my Lord Turnabout, my Lord Timeserver, my
Lord Fair-speech, from whose ancestors that
town first took its name; also Mr. Smooth-man,
Mr. Facing-both-ways, Mr. Anything; and the
parson of our parish, Mr. Two-tongues, was my
mother's own brother by father's side; and to
tell you the truth, I am become a gentleman of
good quality; yet my great-grandfather was but
a waterman, looking one way and rowing another,
and I got most of my estate by the same occupation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Are you a married man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By.</span> Yes, and my wife is a very virtuous
woman, the daughter of a virtuous woman; she
was my Lady Feigning's daughter: therefore she
came of a very honorable family, and is arrived
to such a pitch of breeding, that she knows how
to carry it to all, even to prince and peasant.
'Tis true we somewhat differ in religion from those
of the stricter sort, yet but in two small points:
First, we never strive against wind and tide;
secondly, we are always most zealous when
Religion is well dressed and goes in his silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
slippers: we love much to walk with him in the
street if the sun shines and the people praise him.</p>

<p>Then Christian stepped a little aside to his
fellow Hopeful, saying, "It runs in my mind that
this is one By-ends, of Fair-speech; and if it be he,
we have as very a knave in our company as
dwelleth in all these parts." Then said Hopeful,
"Ask him; methinks he should not be ashamed
of his name." So Christian came up with him
again, and said, "Sir, you talk as if you knew
something more than all the world doth; and if
I take not my mark amiss, I deem I have half a
guess of you. Is not your name Mr. By-ends,
of Fair-speech?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By.</span> This is not my name; but, indeed, it is a
nickname that is given me by some that cannot
abide me, and I must be content to bear it as a
reproach, as other good men have borne theirs
before me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> But did you never give an occasion to
men to call you by this name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By.</span> Never, never! The worst that ever I did
to give them an occasion to give me this name
was, that I had always the luck to jump in my
judgment with the present way of the times,
whatever it was, and my chance was to gain
thereby. But if things are thus cast upon me,
let me count them a blessing; but let not the
malicious load me therefore with reproach.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I thought, indeed, that you were the
man that I heard of; and, to tell you what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
think, I fear this name belongs to you more
properly than you are willing we should think
it doth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By.</span> Well, if you will thus imagine, I cannot
help it: you shall find me a fair company-keeper
if you still admit me your companion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> If you will go with us, you must go
against wind and tide; the which, I perceive, is
against your opinion; you must also own Religion
in his rags, as well as when in his silver slippers;
and stand by him, too, when bound in irons, as
well as when he walketh the streets with applause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By.</span> You must not impose or lord it over my
faith; leave it to my liberty, and let me go with
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Not a step farther, unless you will do
in what I declare as we do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By.</span> Then said By-ends, "I never desert my old
principles, since they are harmless and profitable.
If I may not go with you, I must do as I did before
you overtook me, even go by myself, until some
overtake me that will be glad of my company."</p>

<div class="sidenote">MONEY-LOVE'S PRINCIPLES</div>

<p>Now, I saw in my dream that Christian and
Hopeful forsook him, and kept their distance
before him; but one of them, looking back, saw
three men following Mr. By-ends; and, behold, as
they came up with him, he made them a very low
bow, and they also gave him a compliment. The
men's names were Mr. Hold-the-world, Mr. Money-love,
and Mr. Save-all; men that Mr. By-ends
had been formerly acquainted with; for in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
boyhood they were schoolfellows, and taught by
one Mr. Gripe-man a schoolmaster in Love-gain,
which is a market town in the county of Coveting,
in the North. This schoolmaster taught them the
art of getting, either by violence, cheating, flattery,
lying, or by putting on a pretence of religion; and
these four gentlemen had learned much of the art
of their master, so that they could each of them
have kept such a school themselves.</p>

<p>Well, when they had, as I said, thus saluted
each other, Mr. Money-love said to Mr. By-ends,
"Who are they upon the road before us?" for
Christian and Hopeful were yet within view.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By.</span> They are a couple of far countrymen, that,
after their mode, are going on pilgrimage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Money.</span> Alas! why did they not stay, that we
might have had their good company? for they,
and we, and you, sir, I hope, are all going on
pilgrimage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By.</span> We are so, indeed; but the men before us
are so rigid, and love so much their own notions,
and do also so lightly esteem the opinions of
others, that, let a man be ever so godly, yet, if he
agrees not with them in all things, they thrust
him quite out of their company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Save.</span> That is bad; but we read of some that
are righteous overmuch, and such men's rigidness
makes them to judge and condemn all but themselves.
But I pray, what and how many were the
things wherein you differed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By.</span> Why, they, after their headstrong manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
conclude that it is their duty to rush on their
journey all weathers; and I am for waiting for
wind and tide. They are for taking the risk of all
for God at a clap; and I am for taking all advantages
to secure my life and property. They are
for holding their notions, though all other men
be against them; but I am for religion in what
and so far as, the times and my safety will bear it.
They are for Religion when in rags and contempt;
but I am for him when he walks in his golden
slippers, in the sunshine, and with applause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hold.</span> Ay, and hold you there still, good Mr.
By-ends; for, for my part, I can count him but a
fool, that, having the liberty to keep what he has,
shall be so unwise as to lose it. Let us be wise as
serpents. It is best to make hay while the sun
shines. You see how the bee lieth still all winter,
and bestirs her only when she can have profit and
pleasure. God sends sometimes rain and sometimes
sunshine; if they be such fools to go through
the rain, yet let us be content to take fair weather
along with us. For my part, I like that religion
best that will stand with the safety of God's good
blessings unto us; for who can imagine, that is
ruled by his reason, since God has bestowed upon
us the good things of this life, but that He would
have us keep them for His sake? Abraham and
Solomon grew rich in religion; and Job says that
"a good man should lay up gold as dust;" but he
must not be such as the men before us, if they be
as you have described them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span><span class="smcap">Save.</span> I think that we are all agreed in this
matter, and therefore there needs no more words
about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Money.</span> No, there needs no more words about
this matter, indeed; for he that believes neither
Scripture nor reason (and you see we have both
on our side), neither knows his own liberty nor
seeks his own safety.</p>

<p>And so these four men, Mr. By-ends, Mr.
Money-love, Mr. Save-all, and old Mr. Hold-the-world,
walked on together, while Christian and
Hopeful were far in advance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTIAN AND HOPEFUL</div>

<p>Then Christian and Hopeful went on till they
came to a delicate plain, called Ease, where they
went with much content; but that plain was but
narrow, so they were quickly got over it. Now at
the farther side of that plain was a little hill,
called Lucre,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and in that hill a silver mine,
which some of them that had formerly gone that
way, because of the rarity of it, had turned aside
to see; but going too near the brink of the pit, the
ground, being deceitful under them, broke, and
they were slain; some also had been maimed
there, and could not to their dying day be their
own men again.</p>

<p>Then I saw in my dream that a little off the
road, over against the silver mine, stood Demas
(gentleman-like) to call to passengers to come
and see; who said to Christian and his fellow, "Ho!
turn aside hither, and I will show you a thing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> What thing so deserving as to turn us
out of the way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Demas.</span> Here is a silver mine, and some digging
in it for treasure; if you will come, with a
little pains you may richly provide for yourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Then said Hopeful, "Let us go see."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "Not I," said Christian. "I have heard
of this place before now, and how many have
there been slain; and besides, that treasure is a
snare to those that seek it, for it hindereth them
in their pilgrimage."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then Christian called to Demas, saying,
"Is not the place dangerous? Hath it not
hindered many in their pilgrimage?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Demas.</span> Not very dangerous, except to those
that are careless. But withal, he blushed as he
spake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then said Christian to Hopeful, "Let
us not stir a step, but still keep on our way."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> I will warrant you, when By-ends comes
up, if he hath the same invitation as we, he will
turn in thither to see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> No doubt thereof, for his principles lead
him that way; and a hundred to one but he dies
there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Demas.</span> Then Demas called out again, saying,
"But will you not come over and see?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then Christian roundly answered, saying,
"Demas, thou art an enemy to the right ways
of the Lord of this way, and hast been already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
condemned for thine own turning aside, by one of
His Majesty's judges; and why seekest thou to
have us condemned also? Besides, if we at all
turn aside, our Lord the King will certainly hear
thereof, and will there put us to shame where we
should stand with boldness before Him."</p>

<p>Demas cried again that he also was one of their
company, a pilgrim like themselves, and that, if
they would tarry a little, he also himself would
walk with them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then said Christian, "What is thy name?
Is it not the same by the which I have called
thee?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Demas.</span> Yes, my name is Demas; I am the son
of Abraham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I know you: Gehazi was your great-grandfather,
and Judas your father, and you have
trod in their steps. It is but a devilish prank that
thou usest: thy father was hanged for a traitor,
and thou deservest no better reward. Assure
thyself that when we come to the King, we will
tell him of this thy behavior. Thus they went
their way.</p>

<p>By this time By-ends and his companions were
come again within sight, and they at the first beck
went over to Demas. Now, whether they fell into
the pit by looking over the brink thereof, or
whether they went down to dig, or whether
they were smothered in the bottom by the
damps that commonly arise, of these things
I am not certain; but this I observed, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
they never were seen again in the way. Then
sang Christian:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"By-ends and silver Demas both agree;</span><br />
<span class="i0">One calls; the other runs, that he may be</span><br />
<span class="i0">A sharer in his lucre; so these two</span><br />
<span class="i0">Take up in this world, and no farther go."</span>
</div>

<p>Now, I saw that just on the other side of the
plain the pilgrims came to a place where stood an
old monument hard by the highway-side; at the
sight of which they were both concerned, because
of the strangeness of the form thereof; for it
seemed to them as if it had been a woman changed
into the shape of a pillar. Here, therefore, they
stood looking and looking upon it, but could not
for a time tell what they should make thereof.
At last Hopeful espied written above, upon the
head thereof, a writing in an unusual hand; but
he, being no scholar, called to Christian (for he
was learned,) to see if he could pick out the meaning;
so he came, and after a little laying of letters
together, he found the same to be this, "Remember
Lot's wife." So he read it to his fellow; after
which, they both concluded that that was the
pillar of salt into which Lot's wife was turned, for
her looking back with a covetous heart when she
was going from Sodom. Which sudden and
amazing sight gave them occasion for speaking
thus:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Ah, my brother! this is a seasonable
sight. It came just in time to us after the invitation
which Demas gave us to come over to view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the hill Lucre; and, had we gone over, as he
desired us, and as thou wast inclining to do, my
brother, we had, for aught I know, been made ourselves,
like this woman, a spectacle for those that
shall come after to behold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> I am sorry that I was so foolish, and am
made to wonder that I am not now as Lot's wife;
for wherein was the difference betwixt her sin and
mine? She only looked back, and I had a desire
to go see. Let God's goodness be praised; and
let me be ashamed that ever such a thing should
be in mine heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Let us take notice of what we see here,
for our help for time to come. This woman
escaped one judgment, for she fell not by the
destruction of Sodom; yet she was destroyed by
another, as we see: she is turned into a pillar of
salt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> What a mercy is it that neither thou,
but especially I, am not made myself this example!
This gives reason to us to thank God, to fear before
Him and always to remember Lot's wife.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RIVER OF THE WATER OF LIFE</div>

<p>I saw, then, that they went on their way to a
pleasant river, which David the King called "the
river of God," but John, "the river of the water of
life." Now their way lay just upon the bank of
this river; here, therefore, Christian and his companion
walked with great delight; they drank also
of the water of the river, which was pleasant and
enlivening to their weary spirits. Besides, on the
banks of this river on either side were green trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
that bore all manner of fruit; and the leaves of the
trees were good for medicine; with the fruit of
these trees they were also much delighted; and
the leaves they ate to prevent illness, especially
such diseases that come to those that heat their
blood by travels. On either side of the river was
also a meadow, curiously beautified with lilies,
and it was green all the year long. In this meadow
they lay down and slept, for here they might lie
down safely. When they awoke, they gathered
again of the fruit of the trees and drank again of
the water of the river, and they lay down again to
sleep. This they did several days and nights.
Then they sang:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Behold ye, how these crystal streams do glide,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To comfort pilgrims by the highway-side;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The meadows green, besides their fragrant smell,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Yield dainties for them; and he who can tell</span><br />
<span class="i0">What pleasant fruit, yea, leaves, these trees do yield,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Will soon sell all, that he may buy this field."</span>
</div>

<p>So when they were disposed to go on (for they
were not as yet at their journey's end,) they ate
and drank, and departed.</p>

<p>Now, I beheld in my dream that they had not
journeyed far, but the river and the way for a
time parted, at which they were not a little sorry;
yet they durst not go out of the way. Now the
way from the river was rough, and their feet
tender by reason of their travels; so the souls of
the pilgrims were much discouraged because of
the way. Wherefore, still as they went on they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
wished for a better way. Now, a little before
them there was, on the left hand of the road, a
meadow, and a stile to go over into it, and that
meadow is called By-path Meadow. Then said
Christian to his fellow, "If this meadow lieth
along by our wayside, let's go over it." Then he
went to the stile to see; and behold, a path lay
along by the way on the other side of the fence.
"It is according to my wish," said Christian; "here
is the easiest going. Come, good Hopeful, and
let us go over."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> But how if this path should lead us out
of the way?</p>

<div class="sidenote">VAIN-CONFIDENCE</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "That is not likely," said the other.
"Look, doth it not go along by the wayside?" So
Hopeful, being persuaded by his fellow, went after
him over the stile. When they were gone over,
and were got into the path, they found it very
easy to their feet; and withal, they, looking before
them, espied a man walking as they did, and his
name was Vain-Confidence: so they called after
him, and asked him whither that way led. He
said, "To the Celestial Gate." "Look," said
Christian, "did not I tell you so? By this you
may see we are right." So they followed, and he
went before them. But, behold, the night came
on, and it grew very dark; so that they that were
behind lost sight of him that went before. He,
therefore, that went before (Vain-Confidence by
name) not seeing the way before him, fell into
a deep pit, which was on purpose there made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
by the prince of those grounds to catch
careless fools, withal and was dashed in pieces
with his fall.</p>

<p>Now Christian and his fellow heard him fall.
So they called to know the matter; but there was
none to answer, only they heard a groaning.
Then said Hopeful, "Where are we now?" Then
was his fellow silent, as mistrusting that he had
led him out of the way; and now it began to rain,
and thunder, and lighten in a most dreadful manner,
and the water rose amain.</p>

<p>Then Hopeful groaned in himself, saying, "Oh
that I had kept on my way!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Who could have thought that this path
should have led us out of the way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> I was afraid on't at the very first, and
therefore gave you that gentle caution. I would
have spoken plainer, but that you are older than I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Good brother, be not offended. I am
very sorry I have brought thee out of the way,
and that I have put thee into such great danger.
Pray, my brother, forgive me: I did not do it of
any evil intent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Be comforted, my brother, for I forgive
thee, and believe, too, that this shall be for our
good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I am glad I have with me a merciful
brother; but we must not stand still: let us try
to go back again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> But, good brother, let me go before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> No, if you please; let me go first, that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
if there be any danger, I may be first therein,
because by my means we are both gone out of
the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> "No, you shall not go first; for your
mind being troubled may lead you out of the
way again." Then for their encouragement they
heard the voice of one saying, "Let thine heart
be towards the highway, even the way that thou
wentest; turn again." But by this time the
waters were greatly risen, by reason of which
the way of going back was very dangerous.
(Then I thought that it is easier going out of the
way when we are in, than going in when we are
out.) Yet they undertook to go back; but it was
so dark, and the flood so high, that, in their going
back, they had like to have been drowned nine or
ten times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIANT DESPAIR</div>

<p>Neither could they, with all the skill they had,
get again to the stile that night. Wherefore, at
last lighting under a little shelter, they sat down
there until daybreak; but, being weary, they fell
asleep. Now, there was, not far from the place
where they lay, a castle, called Doubting Castle
the owner whereof was Giant Despair, and it was
in his grounds they now were sleeping; wherefore
he, getting up in the morning early, and walking
up and down in his fields, caught Christian and
Hopeful asleep in his grounds. Then, with a
grim and surly voice, he bid them awake, and
asked them whence they were, and what they did
in his grounds. They told him they were pilgrims,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and that they had lost their way. Then said the
giant, "You have this night trespassed on me by
trampling in and lying on my grounds, and therefore
you must go along with me." So they were
forced to go, because he was stronger than they.
They had also but little to say, for they knew
themselves in fault. The giant, therefore, drove
them before him, and put them into his castle,
into a very dark dungeon, nasty and smelling
vilely to the spirits of these two men. Here, then,
they lay from Wednesday morning till Saturday
night, without one bit of bread or drop of drink,
or light, or any to ask how they did; they were,
therefore, here in evil case, and were far from
friends and people whom they knew. Now, in
this place Christian had double sorrow, because
it was through his thoughtless haste that they
were brought into this distress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PILGRIMS IN A DUNGEON</div>

<p>Now, Giant Despair had a wife, and her name
was Diffidence. So, when he was gone to bed, he
told his wife what he had done; to wit, that he
had taken a couple of prisoners and cast them into
his dungeon for trespassing on his grounds. Then
he asked her also what he had best to do further
to them. So she asked him what they were,
whence they came, and whither they were bound;
and he told her. Then she advised him, that
when he arose in the morning, he should beat
them without any mercy. So, when he arose, he
getteth him a grievous crab-tree cudgel, and goes
down into the dungeon to them, and there first fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to abusing them as if they were dogs, although
they never gave him a word of distaste. Then he
falls upon them, and beats them fearfully, in such
sort that they were not able to help themselves, or
to turn them upon the floor. This done, he withdraws
and leaves them there to sorrow over their
misery and to mourn under their distress. So all
that day they spent their time in nothing but sighs
and bitter grief. The next night she, talking with
her husband about them further, and understanding
that they were yet alive, did advise him to tell
them to make away with themselves. So, when
morning was come, he goes to them in a surly
manner, as before and, perceiving them to be
very sore with the stripes that he had given them
the day before, he told them that, since they were
never like to come out of that place, their only
way would be forthwith to make an end of themselves,
either with knife, halter, or poison: "For
why," said he, "should you choose life, seeing it is
attended with so much bitterness?" But they
desired him to let them go. With that, he looked
ugly upon them, and rushing to them, had doubtless
made an end of them himself, but that he fell
into one of his fits (for he sometimes, in sunshiny
weather, fell into fits), and lost for a time the use
of his hands, wherefore he withdrew, and left
them as before to consider what to do. Then did
the prisoners consult between themselves, whether
it was best to take his advice or no; and thus they
began to discourse:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "Brother," said Christian, "what shall
we do? The life we now live is miserable. For
my part, I know not whether is best, to live thus,
or to die out of hand. My soul chooseth strangling
rather than life, and the grave is more easy
for me than this dungeon. Shall we be ruled by
the giant?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOPEFUL CHEERS CHRISTIAN</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Indeed, our present condition is dreadful;
and death would be far more welcome to me
than thus for ever to abide. But yet, let us
think: the Lord of the country to which we are
going hath said, "Thou shalt do no murder," no,
not to another man's person; much more, then,
are we forbidden to take his advice to kill ourselves.
Besides, he that kills another can but commit
murder upon his body; but for one to kill himself
is to kill body and soul at once. And, moreover,
my brother, thou talkest of ease in the grave; but
hast thou forgotten the hell, whither, for certain,
the murderers go? for "no murderer hath eternal
life." And let us consider again, that all the law
is not in the hand of Giant Despair: others, so far
as I can understand, have been taken by him as
well as we, and yet have escaped out of his hand.
Who knows but that God, who made the world,
may cause that Giant Despair may die? or that,
at some time or other, he may forget to lock us in?
or that he may, in a short time, have another of his
fits before us, and he may lose the use of his limbs?
and if ever that should come to pass again, for my
part, I am resolved to pluck up the heart of a man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and try to my utmost to get from under his hand.
I was a fool that I did not try to do it before. But
however, my brother, let us be patient, and endure
awhile: the time may come that may give us a
happy release; but let us not be our own murderers.</p>

<p>With these words, Hopeful at present did calm
the mind of his brother; so they continued
together in the dark that day, in their sad and
doleful condition.</p>

<p>Well, towards evening, the giant goes down into
the dungeon again, to see if his prisoners had taken
his counsel. But, when he came there, he found
them alive; and truly, alive was all; for now,
what for want of bread and water, and by reason
of the wounds they received when he beat them,
they could do little but breathe. But, I say, he
found them alive; at which he fell into a grievous
rage, and told them that, seeing they had disobeyed
his counsel, it should be worse with them
than if they had never been born.</p>

<p>At this they trembled greatly, and I think that
Christian fell into a swoon; but, coming a little
to himself again, they renewed their discourse
about the giant's advice and whether yet they had
best to take it or no. Now, Christian again
seemed for doing it; but Hopeful made his second
reply as followeth:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> "My brother," said he, "rememberest
thou not how valiant thou hast been heretofore?
Apollyon could not crush thee, nor could all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
thou didst hear, or see, or feel in the Valley of the
Shadow of Death. What hardship, terror, and
amazement hast thou already gone through! and
art thou now nothing but fear? Thou seest that
I am in the dungeon with thee, a far weaker man
by nature than thou art; also this giant has
wounded me as well as thee, and hath also cut off
the bread and water from my mouth; and, with
thee, I mourn without the light. But let us have
a little more patience. Remember how thou
showedst thyself the man at Vanity Fair, and wast
neither afraid of the chain, nor cage, nor yet of
bloody death. Wherefore, let us (at least to
avoid the shame that it becomes not a Christian
to be found in) bear up with patience as well as
we can."</p>

<p>Now, night being come again, and the giant
and his wife being in bed, she asked him concerning
the prisoners, and if they had taken his
advice: to which he replied, "They are sturdy
rogues; they choose rather to bear all hardship
than to make away with themselves." Then
said she, "Take them unto the castle-yard
to-morrow, and show them the bones and
skulls of those that thou hast already killed;
and make them believe, ere a week comes
to an end, thou wilt tear them also in
pieces, as thou hast done their fellows before
them."</p>

<p>So when the morning was come, the giant goes
to them again, and takes them into the castle-yard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and shows them as his wife had bidden him.
"These," said he, "were pilgrims, as you are, once,
and they trespassed in my grounds as you have
done; and when I thought fit, I tore them in
pieces; and so within ten days I will do you. Go,
get you down to your den again." And, with
that, he beat them all the way thither. They lay,
therefore, all day on Saturday in a lamentable
case, as before. Now, when night was come, and
when Mrs. Diffidence and her husband, the giant
were got to bed, they began to renew their talking
of their prisoners; and withal, the old giant
wondered that he could neither by his blows nor
counsel bring them to an end. And, with that,
his wife replied, "I fear," said she, "that they
live in hope that some will come to relieve
them; or that they have picklocks about
them, by the means of which they hope to
escape." "And sayest thou so, my dear?" said
the giant: "I will therefore search them in the
morning."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PILGRIMS ESCAPE</div>

<p>Well, on Saturday about midnight, they began
to pray, and continued in prayer till almost break
of day.</p>

<p>Now, a little before it was day, good Christian,
as one half amazed, brake out into this earnest
speech: "What a fool," quoth he, "am I to lie in a
foul-smelling dungeon, when I may as well walk
at liberty! I have a key in my bosom called
Promise, that will, I am sure, open any lock in
Doubting Castle." Then said Hopeful, "That is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
good news, good brother: pluck it out of thy
bosom, and try."</p>

<p>Then Christian pulled it out of his bosom, and
began to try at the dungeon door, whose bolt, as
he turned the key, gave back, and the door flew
open with ease, and Christian and Hopeful both
came out. Then he went to the outward door
that leads into the castle-yard, and with his key
opened that door also. After, he went to the iron
gate, for that must be opened too; but that lock
went exceedingly hard, yet the key did open it.
Then they thrust open the gate to make their
escape with speed; but that gate, as it opened,
made such a creaking, that it waked Giant Despair
who, hastily rising to pursue his prisoners, felt his
limbs to fail; for his fits took him again, so that he
could by no means go after them. Then they
went on, and came to the King's highway again,
and so were safe because they were out of Giant
Despair's rule.</p>

<p>Now, when they were gone over the stile, they
began to contrive with themselves what they
should do at that stile to prevent those that
should come after from falling into the hands of
Giant Despair. So they agreed to build there a
pillar, and to engrave upon the side thereof this
sentence: "Over this stile is the way to Doubting
Castle, which is kept by Giant Despair, who
despiseth the King of the Celestial Country, and
seeks to destroy His holy pilgrims." Many,
therefore, that followed after, read what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
written, and escaped the danger. This done,
they sang as follows:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Out of the way we went, and then we found</span><br />
<span class="i0">What 'twas to tread upon forbidden ground:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And let them that come after have a care,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lest heedlessness make them as we to fare;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lest they for trespassing his prisoners are</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whose Castle's Doubting, and whose name's Despair."</span>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class="sidenote">THE DELECTABLE MOUNTAINS</div>
<p>They went then till they came to the Delectable<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Mountains, which mountains belong
to the Lord of that hill of which we
have spoken before. So they went up to the
mountains to behold the gardens and orchards,
the vineyards and fountains of water, where
also they drank and washed themselves, and did
freely eat of the vineyards. Now there were on
the tops of these mountains shepherds feeding
their flocks, and they stood by the highway-side.
The pilgrims, therefore, went to them, and leaning
upon their staves (as is common with weary
pilgrims when they stand to talk with any by
the way), they asked, "Whose delightful mountains
are these, and whose be the sheep that
feed upon them?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shep.</span> These mountains are Immanuel's Land,
and they are within sight of His city; and the
sheep also are His, and He laid down His life for
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Is this the way to the Celestial City?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shep.</span> You are just in your way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> How far is it thither?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shep.</span> Too far for any but those who shall get
thither indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Is the way safe or dangerous?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span><span class="smcap">Shep.</span> Safe for those for whom it is to be safe;
but sinners shall fall therein.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Is there in this place any relief for pilgrims
that are weary and faint in the way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shep.</span> The Lord of these mountains hath given
us a charge not to be forgetful to care for strangers;
therefore the good of the place is before you.</p>

<p>I saw also in my dream that when the shepherds
perceived that they were wayfaring men, they also
put questions to them (to which they made answer
as in other places), as, "Whence came you?" and
"How got you into the way?" and, "By what
means have you so persevered therein? for but few
of them that begin to come hither do show their
faces on these mountains." But when the shepherds
heard their answers, being pleased therewith
they looked very lovingly upon them, and said,
"Welcome to the Delectable Mountains!"</p>

<p>The shepherds, I say, whose names were Knowledge,
Experience, Watchful, and Sincere, took
them by the hand and took them to their tents,
and made them partake of what was ready at
present. They said moreover, "We would that
you should stay here awhile, to be acquainted
with us, and yet more to cheer yourselves with the
good of these Delectable Mountains." They then
told them that they were content to stay. So
they went to rest that night, because it was very late.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SHEPHERDS CONDUCT THEM</div>

<p>Then I saw in my dream that in the morning
the shepherds called up Christian and Hopeful to
walk with them upon the mountains. So they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
went forth with them and walked a while, having
a pleasant prospect on every side. Then said the
shepherds one to another, "Shall we show these
pilgrims some wonders?" So, when they had
concluded to do it, they had them first to the top
of the hill called Error, which was very steep on
the farthest side, and bid them look down to the
bottom. So Christian and Hopeful looked down,
and saw at the bottom several men dashed all to
pieces by a fall they had had from the top. Then
said Christian, "What meaneth this?" Then the
shepherds answered, "Have you not heard of
them that were made to err, by hearkening to
Hymeneus and Philetus, as concerning the faith
of the rising from the dead?" They answered,
"Yes." Then said the shepherds, "Those you see
lie dashed to pieces at the bottom of this mountain
are they; and they have continued to this day
unburied, as you see, for an example to others to
take heed how they clamber too high, or how they
come too near the brink of this mountain."</p>

<p>Then I saw that they had them to the top of
another mountain, and the name of that is Caution
and bid them look afar off; and when they did,
they perceived, as they thought, several men
walking up and down among the tombs that were
there; and they perceived that the men were
blind, because they stumbled sometimes upon the
tombs, and because they could not get out from
among them. Then said Christian, "What means
this?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>The shepherds then answered, "Did you not
see a little below these mountains a stile that led
into a meadow on the left hand side of this way?"
They answered, "Yes." Then said the shepherds,
"From that stile there goes a path that leads
directly to Doubting Castle, which is kept by
Giant Despair; and these men" (pointing to them
among the tombs) "came once on pilgrimage, as
you do now, even until they came to that same
stile. And because the right way was rough in
that place, they chose to go out of it into that
meadow, and there were taken by Giant Despair,
and cast into Doubting Castle, where, after they
had been kept a while in the dungeon, he at last
did put out their eyes, and led them among those
tombs, where he has left them to wander to this
very day, that the saying of the Wise Man might
be fulfilled, 'He that wandereth out of the way of
knowledge, shall remain in the congregation of the
dead.'" Then Christian and Hopeful looked
upon one another with tears gushing out, but yet
said nothing to the shepherds.</p>

<p>Then I saw in my dream, that the shepherds
had them to another place in a bottom, where was
a door on the side of a hill; and they opened the
door, and bid them look in. They looked in,
therefore, and saw that within it was very dark
and smoky; they also thought that they heard
there a rumbling noise, as of fire, and a cry of some
tormented, and that they smelt the scent of brimstone.
Then said Christian, "What means this?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
The shepherds told them, "This is a by-way to
hell, a way that hypocrites go in at: namely, such
as sell their birthright, with Esau; such as sell
their master, with Judas; such as blaspheme the
Gospel, with Alexander; and that lie and deceive
with Ananias and Sapphira his wife."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Then said Hopeful to the shepherds,
"I perceive that these had on them, even every
one, a show of pilgrimage, as we have now; had
they not?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shep.</span> Yes, and held it a long time too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> How far might they go on in pilgrimage
in their day, since they notwithstanding were thus
miserably cast away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shep.</span> Some farther, and some not so far as
these mountains.</p>

<p>Then said the pilgrims one to another, "We
have need to cry to the Strong for strength."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shep.</span> Ay, and you will have need to use it
when you have it, too.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GATE OF THE CELESTIAL CITY</div>

<p>By this time the pilgrims had a desire to go
forward, and the shepherds a desire they should;
so they walked together towards the end of the
mountains. Then said the shepherds one to
another, "Let us here show to the pilgrims the
gate of the Celestial City, if they have skill to look
through our perspective glass."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The pilgrims
then lovingly accepted the motion; so they had
them to the top of a high hill called Clear, and gave
them their glass to look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>Then they tried to look; but the remembrance
of that last thing, that the shepherds had showed
them, made their hands shake, by means of which
hindrance they could not look steadily through
the glass; yet they thought they saw something
like the gate, and also some of the glory of the
place. Thus they went away, and sang this song:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Thus by the shepherds secrets are revealed,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which from all other men are kept concealed.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Come to the shepherds, then, if you would see</span><br />
<span class="i0">Things deep, things hid, and that mysterious be."</span>
</div>

<p>When they were about to depart, one of the
shepherds gave them a note of the way. Another
of them bid them beware of the Flatterer. The
third bid them take heed that they slept not upon
the Enchanted Ground. And the fourth bid
them God speed.</p>

<p>So I awoke from my dream.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<div class="sidenote">THEY OVERTAKE IGNORANCE</div>

<p>And I slept, and dreamed again, and saw
the same two pilgrims going down the
mountains along the highway towards
the city. Now, a little below these mountains,
on the left hand, lieth the country of Conceit;
from which country there comes into the way in
which the pilgrims walked a little crooked lane.
Here, therefore, they met with a very brisk lad,
that came out of that country, and his name was
Ignorance. So Christian asked him from what
parts he came, and whither he was going.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignor.</span> Sir, I was born in the country that
lieth off there a little on the left hand, and I am
going to the Celestial City.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> But how do you think to get in at the
gate? for you may find some difficulty there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignor.</span> As other people do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> But what have you to show at the gate,
that may cause that the gate should be opened
to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignor.</span> I know my Lord's will, and have been a
good liver; I pay every man his own; I pray, fast,
pay money to the church and give to the poor, and
have left my country for whither I am going.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> But thou camest not in at the wicket-gate
that is at the head of this way: thou camest
in hither through that same crooked lane; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
therefore I fear, however thou mayest think of thyself,
when the reckoning day shall come, thou wilt
have laid to thy charge that thou art a thief and a
robber, instead of getting admittance into the city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignor.</span> Gentlemen, ye be utter strangers to me:
I know you not: be content to follow the custom
of your country, and I will follow the custom of
mine. I hope all will be well. And, as for the
gate that you talk of, all the world knows that
that is a great way off of our country. I cannot
think that any man in all our parts doth so much
as know the way to it; nor need they matter
whether they do or no, since we have, as you see,
a fine, pleasant green lane, that comes down from
our country, the next way into the way.</p>

<p>When Christian saw that the man was wise in
his own opinion, he said to Hopeful, whisperingly,
"There is more hope of a fool than of him." And
said, moreover "When he that is a fool walketh
by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith
to every one that he is a fool. What! shall we
talk further with him, or outgo him at present,
and so leave him to think of what he hath heard
already, and then stop again for him afterwards,
and see if by degrees we can do any good to him?"</p>

<p>Then said Hopeful:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Let Ignorance a little while now muse</span><br />
<span class="i0">On what is said, and let him not refuse</span><br />
<span class="i0">Good counsel to embrace, lest he remain</span><br />
<span class="i0">Still ignorant of what's the chiefest gain.</span><br />
<span class="i0">God saith, those that no understanding have</span><br />
<span class="i0">(Although He made them), them He will not save."</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> He further added, "It is not good, I
think, to say all to him at once: let us pass him by,
if you will, and talk to him by and by, even as he
is able to bear it."</p>

<p>So they both went on, and Ignorance he came
after. Now, when they had passed him a little
way, they entered into a very dark lane, where
they met a man whom seven devils had bound
with seven strong cords, and were carrying of him
back to the door that they saw on the side of the
hill. Now good Christian began to tremble, and
so did Hopeful his companion; yet, as the devils
led away the man, Christian looked to see if he
knew him; and he thought it might be one Turn-away,
that dwelt in the town of Apostasy. But
he did not perfectly see his face, for he did hang
his head like a thief that is found; but being gone
past, Hopeful looked after him, and espied on his
back a paper with this inscription, "One who was
wicked while claiming to be good, and turned away
from God."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THREE STURDY ROGUES</div>

<p>Then said Christian to his fellow, "Now I call to
remembrance that which was told of a thing that
happened to a good man hereabout. The name
of that man was Little-Faith, but a good man, and
dwelt in the town of Sincere. The thing was this:
At the entering in at this passage, there comes
down from Broad-way Gate a lane called Dead
Man's Lane; so-called because of the murders that
are commonly done there; and this Little-Faith,
going on pilgrimage as we do now, chanced to sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
down there, and slept. Now, there happened at
that time to come down that lane, from Broad-way
Gate, three sturdy rogues, and their names were
Faint-heart, Mistrust, and Guilt, three brothers;
and they espying Little-Faith, where he was, came
galloping up with speed. Now, the good man was
just awaked from his sleep, and was getting up to
go on his journey. So they came up all to him,
and with threatening language bid him stand.
At this, Little-Faith looked as white as a sheet
and had neither power to fight nor fly. Then said
Faint-heart, 'Deliver thy purse;' but, he making
no haste to do it (for he was loth to lose his money)
Mistrust ran up to him, and, thrusting his hand
into his pocket, pulled out thence a bag of silver.
Then he cried out, 'Thieves! thieves!' With that,
Guilt, with a great club that was in his hand,
struck Little-Faith on the head, and with that
blow felled him flat to the ground, where he lay
bleeding as one that would bleed to death. All
this while the thieves stood by. But, at last, they
hearing that some were upon the road, and fearing
lest it should be one Great-Grace, that dwells in
the city of Good-Confidence, they betook themselves
to their heels, and left this good man to
shift for himself. Now, after a while, Little-Faith
came to himself, and, getting up, made shift to
scramble on his way. This was the story."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> But did they take from him all that ever
he had?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> No; the place where his jewels were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
they never ransacked; so those he kept still. But
as I was told, the good man was much afflicted for
his loss, for the thieves got most of his spending
money. That which they got not, as I said, were
jewels; also he had a little odd money left, but
scarce enough to bring him to his journey's end.
Nay, if I was not misinformed, he was forced to
beg as he went, to keep himself alive, for his jewels
he might not sell; but, beg and do what he could,
he went, as we say, often with a hungry stomach
the most part of the rest of the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> But is it not a wonder they got not from
him his certificate, by which he was to receive
admission at the Celestial Gate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> It is a wonder; but they got not that,
though they missed it not through any cunning of
his; for he, being dismayed by their coming upon
him, had neither power nor skill to hide anything;
so it was more by good providence than by his
endeavor, that they missed of that good thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> But it must needs be a comfort to him
that they got not his jewels from him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> It might have been great comfort to
him, had he used it as he should; but they that
told me the story said, that he made but little use
of it all the rest of the way, and that because of the
alarm that he had in their taking away his money.
Indeed, he forgot it a great part of the rest of his
journey; and besides, when at any time it came
into his mind, and he began to be comforted therewith,
then would fresh thoughts of his loss come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
again upon him, and those thoughts would
swallow up all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOPEFUL REBUKED</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Alas, poor man! this could not but be a
great grief unto him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Grief! ay, a grief indeed. Would it not
have been so to any of us, had we been used as he,
to be robbed and wounded too, and that in a
strange place, as he was? It is a wonder he did
not die with grief, poor heart! I was told that he
scattered almost all the rest of the way with nothing
but doleful and bitter complaints; telling also
to all that overtook him, or that he overtook in
the way as he went, where he was robbed, and
how; who they were that did it, and what he had
lost; how he was wounded, and that he hardly
escaped with life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> But it is a wonder that his necessities
did not put him upon selling or pawning some of
his jewels, that he might have wherewith to
relieve himself in his journey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Thou talkest like one whose head is
thick to this very day. For what should he pawn
them, or to whom should he sell them? In all
that country where he was robbed, his jewels were
not accounted of; nor did he want that relief
which could from thence be administered to him.
Besides, had his jewels been missing at the gate of
the Celestial City, he had (and that he knew well
enough) been shut out from an inheritance there;
and that would have been worse to him than the
coming and villany of ten thousand thieves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> But, Christian, these three fellows,
I am persuaded in my heart, are but a company
of cowards: would they have run else,
think you, as they did at the noise of one
that was coming on the road? Why did not
Little-Faith pluck up a greater heart? He
might, methinks, have stood one brush with
them, and have yielded when there had been
no remedy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> That they are cowards many have said,
but few have found it so in the time of trial. As
for a great heart, Little-Faith had none; and I
perceive by thee, my brother, hadst thou been the
man concerned, thou art but for a brush, and then
to yield. And, verily, since this is the height of
thy courage now they are at a distance from us,
should they appear to thee as they did to him,
they might put thee to second thoughts. But
consider again, they are but journeymen-thieves;
they serve under the king of the bottomless pit,
who, if need be, will come in to their aid himself,
and his voice is as the roaring of a lion. I myself
have been engaged as this Little-Faith was, and I
found it a terrible thing. These three villains
set upon me: and I beginning like a Christian to
resist, they gave but a call, and in came their
master. I would, as the saying is, have given my
life for a penny, but that, as God would have it,
I was clothed with armor of proof. Ay, and yet,
though I was so protected, I found it hard work
to quit myself like a man. No man can tell what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
in that combat attends us, but he that hath been
in the battle himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Well, but they ran, you see, when they
did but suppose that one Great-Grace was in the
way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> True, they have often fled, both they
and their master, when Great-Grace hath but
appeared; and no marvel, for he is the King's
champion. But I trow you will put some difference
between Little-Faith and the King's
champion? All the King's subjects are not His
champions, nor can they when tried do such feats
of war as he. Is it meet to think that a little child
should handle Goliath as David did? or that there
should be the strength of an ox in a wren? Some
are strong, some are weak; some have great faith,
some have little: this man was one of the weak,
and therefore he went to the wall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> I would it had been Great-Grace for
their sakes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> If it had been he, he might have had his
hands full; for I must tell you that though Great-Grace
is excellent good at his weapons, and has,
and can, so long as he keeps them at sword's point,
do well enough with them; yet, if they get within
him, even Faint-heart, Mistrust, or the other, it
shall go hard but they will throw up his heels.
And when a man is down, you know, what can
he do?</p>

<p>Whoso looks well upon Great-Grace's face will
see those scars and cuts there, that shall easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
give proof of what I say. Yea, once I heard that
he should say (and that when he was in the combat),
"We despaired even of life." How did these
sturdy rogues and their fellows make David groan,
mourn, and roar! Yea, Heman, and Hezekiah
too, though champions in their days, were forced
to bestir when by these attacked; and yet, notwithstanding,
they had their coats soundly
brushed by them. Peter, upon a time, would go
try what he could do; but though some do say of
him that he is the prince of the apostles, they
handled him so that they made him at last afraid
of a sorry girl.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LITTLE-FAITH AMONG THIEVES</div>

<p>Besides, their king is at their whistle&mdash;he is
never out of hearing; and if at any time they be
put to the worst, he, if possible, comes in to help
them; and of him it is said, "The sword of him
that layeth at him cannot hold; the spear, the
dart, nor the habergeon. He esteemeth iron as
straw, and brass as rotten wood. The arrow cannot
make him flee; sling-stones are turned with
him into stubble. Darts are counted as stubble:
he laugheth at the shaking of a spear." What
can a man do in this case? It is true, if a man
could at every turn have Job's horse, and had
skill and courage to ride him, he might do notable
things. For his neck is clothed with thunder.
He will not be afraid as the grasshopper: "the
glory of his nostrils is terrible. He paweth in the
valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on
to meet the armed men. He mocketh at fear, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
is not affrighted, neither turneth he his back from
the sword. The quiver rattleth against him, the
glittering spear and the shield. He swalloweth
the ground with fierceness and rage; neither
believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.
He saith among the trumpets, Ha! ha! and he
smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the
captains, and the shouting."</p>

<p>But for such footmen as thee and I are, let us
never desire to meet with an enemy, nor vaunt as
if we could do better, when we hear of others that
have been foiled, nor be tickled at the thoughts of
our manhood; for such commonly come by the
worst when tried. Witness Peter, of whom I
made mention before: he would swagger, ay, he
would; he would, as his vain mind prompted him
to say, do better and stand more for his Master
than all men; but who so foiled and run down by
those villains as he?</p>

<p>Then Christian sang:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Poor Little-Faith! hast been among the thieves?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Wast robbed? Remember this: whoso believes</span><br />
<span class="i0">And gets more faith, shall then a victor be</span><br />
<span class="i0">Over ten thousand; else, scarce over three."</span>
</div>

<p>So they went on, and Ignorance followed. They
went then till they came to a place where they saw
a way put itself into their way, and seemed withal
to lie as straight as the way which they should go;
and here they knew not which of the two to take,
for both seemed straight before them; therefore
here they stood still to consider. And, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
were thinking about the way, behold, a man,
black of flesh, but covered with a very light robe,
came to them, and asked them why they stood
there. They answered they were going to the
Celestial City, but knew not which of these ways
to take. "Follow me," said the man; "it is
thither that I am going." So they followed him
to the way that but now came into the road, which
by degrees turned and turned them so from the
city that they desired to go to, that, in a little time,
their faces were turned away from it; yet they
followed him. But by-and-by, before they were
aware, he led them both within the folds of a net,
in which they were both so entangled that they
knew not what to do; and with that, the white
robe fell off the black man's back. Then they
saw where they were. Wherefore, there they lay
crying some time, for they could not get themselves
out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then said Christian to his fellow, "Now
do I see myself in an error. Did not the shepherds
bid us beware of flatterers? As is the saying of
the Wise Man, so we have found it this day: 'A
man that flattereth his neighbor, spreadeth a net
at his feet.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">A SHINING ONE APPEARS</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> They also gave us a note of directions
about the way, for our more sure finding thereof;
but therein we have also forgotten to read, and
have not kept ourselves from the paths of the
destroyer. Thus they lay bewailing themselves
in the net. At last they espied a Shining One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
coming towards them with a whip of small cord in
his hand. When he was come to the place where
they were, he asked them whence they came, and
what they did there. They told him that they
were poor pilgrims going to Zion, but were led out
of their way by a black man clothed in white,
"Who bid us," said they, "follow him, for he was
going thither too." Then said he with the whip,
"It is Flatterer, a false prophet, that hath changed
himself into an angel of light." So he rent the
net, and let the men out. Then said he to them,
"Follow me, that I may set you in your way
again." So he led them back to the way which
they had left to follow the Flatterer. Then he
asked them, saying, "Where did you lie the last
night?" They said, "With the shepherds upon
the Delectable Mountains." He asked them then
if they had not of those shepherds a note of direction
for the way. They answered, "Yes." "But
did you not," said he, "when you were at a stand,
pluck out and read your note?" They answered,
"No." He asked them, "Why?" They said they
forgot. He asked them, moreover, if the shepherds
did not bid them beware of the Flatterer.
They answered, "Yes; but we did not imagine,"
said they, "that this fine-spoken man had been
he."</p>

<p>Then I saw in my dream, that he commanded
them to lie down; which when they did, he
whipped them sore, to teach them the good way
wherein they should walk; and, as he whipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
them, he said, "As many as I love, I rebuke and
chasten; be zealous, therefore, and repent."
This done, he bid them go on their way, and take
good heed to the other directions of the shepherds.
So they thanked him for all his kindness, and went
softly along the right way, singing:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Come hither, you that walk along the way,</span><br />
<span class="i0">See how the pilgrims fare that go astray;</span><br />
<span class="i0">They catchd are in an entangling net,</span><br />
<span class="i0">'Cause they good counsel lightly did forget;</span><br />
<span class="i0">'Tis true, they rescued were; but yet, you see,</span><br />
<span class="i0">They're scourged to boot: let this your caution be."</span>
</div>

<p>Now, after awhile they perceived afar off, one
coming softly and alone, all along the highway,
to meet them. Then said Christian to his fellow,
"Yonder is a man with his back towards Zion,
and he is coming to meet us."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> I see him: let us take heed to ourselves
lest he should prove a flatterer also.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEY MEET ATHEIST</div>

<p>So he drew nearer and nearer, and at last came
up to them. His name was Atheist,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and he
asked them whither they were going.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> We are going to Mount Zion.</p>

<p>Then Atheist fell into a very great laughter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> What is the meaning of your laughter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atheist.</span> I laugh to see what ignorant persons
you are, to take upon yourselves so tedious a
journey, and yet are like to have nothing but your
travel for your pains.<a name="Hopeful" id="Hopeful"></a></p>

<small>See page 170</small>

</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Why, man, do you think we shall not
be received?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atheist.</span> Received! There is no such a place
as you dream of in all this world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> But there is in the world to come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atheist.</span> When I was at home in mine own
country, I heard as you now affirm, and, from that
hearing, went out to see, and have been seeking
this city these twenty years, but find no more of
it than I did the first day I set out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> We have both heard and believe that
there is such a place to be found.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atheist.</span> Had not I, when at home, believed
I had not come thus far to seek; but, finding none
(and yet I should had there been such a place to
be found, for I have gone to seek it farther than
you), I am going back again, and will seek to
refresh myself with the things that I then cast
away for hopes of that which I now see is not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then said Christian to Hopeful his
fellow, "Is it true which this man hath said?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Take heed; he is one of the flatterers.
Remember what it hath cost us once already for
hearkening to such kind of fellows. What! no
Mount Zion? Did we not see from the Delectable
Mountains the gate of the city? Also, are we not
now to walk by faith? Let us go on, lest the man
with the whip overtake us again. I say, my
brother, cease to hear him, and let us believe to
the saving of the soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> My brother, I did not put the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
to thee for that I doubted of the truth of our
belief myself, but to prove thee, and to fetch
from thee a fruit of the honesty of thy heart. As
for this man, I know that he is blinded. Let thee
and me go on, knowing that we have belief of the
truth, and no lie is of the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Now do I rejoice in hope of the glory of
God.</p>

<p>So they turned away from the man, and he,
laughing at them, went his way.</p>

<p>I then saw in my dream that they went till they
came into a certain country, whose air naturally
tended to make one drowsy if he came a stranger
into it. And here Hopeful began to be very dull
and heavy of sleep; wherefore he said unto Christian,
"I do now begin to grow so drowsy, that I
can scarcely hold up mine eyes; let us lie down
here, and take one nap."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "By no means," said the other, "lest
sleeping, we never awake more."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Why, my brother? sleep is sweet to the
laboring man: we may be refreshed if we take
a nap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Do not you remember that one of the
shepherds bid us beware of the Enchanted
Ground? He meant by that that we should
beware of sleeping; wherefore let us not sleep as
others, but let us watch and be sober.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> I acknowledge myself in fault; and had
I been here alone, I had, by sleeping, run the
danger of death. I see it is true that the Wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Man saith, "Two are better than one." Hitherto
hath thy company been my help; and thou shalt
have a good reward for thy labor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> "Now, then," said Christian, "to prevent
drowsiness in this place, let us talk about
something profitable."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> With all my heart.</p>
<div class="sidenote">HOPEFUL NARRATES CONVERSION</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Where shall we begin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Where God began with us. But do you
begin, if you please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> I will sing you first this song:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"When saints do sleepy grow, let them come hither,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And hear how these two pilgrims talk together;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Yea, let them learn of them, in any wise,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thus to keep ope their drowsy, slumbering eyes.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Saints' fellowship, if it be managed well,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Keeps them awake, and that in spite of hell."</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then Christian began, and said, "I will
ask you a question. How came you to think at
first of doing as you do now?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Do you mean, how came I at first to
look after the good of my soul?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Yes, that is my meaning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> I continued a great while in the delight
of those things which were seen and sold at our
fair; things which I believe now would have, had
I continued in them still, drowned me in ruin and
destruction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> What things were they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> All the treasures and riches of the world.
Also I delighted much in rioting, revelling, drinking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
swearing, lying, uncleanness, Sabbath-breaking,
and what not, that tended to destroy the soul.
But I found at last, by hearing and considering
of things that are holy, which indeed I heard of
you, as also of beloved Faithful, that was put to
death for his faith, and good living in Vanity Fair,
that the end of these things is death; and that,
for these things' sake, the wrath of God cometh
upon those who disobey him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> And did you presently fall under the
power of this feeling?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> No; I was not willing presently to know
the evil of sin, nor the destruction that follows
upon the doing of it; but tried, when my mind at
first began to be shaken with the Word, to shut
mine eyes against the light thereof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> But what was the cause of your waiting
so long?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> The causes were,&mdash;Firstly, I was ignorant
that this was the work of God upon me.
Secondly, Sin was yet very sweet to my flesh, and
I was loth to leave it. Thirdly, I could not tell
how to part with mine old companions, their
presence and actions were so desirable unto me.
Fourthly, The hours in which these feelings were
upon me, were such troublesome and such heart-affrighting
hours, that I could not bear, no, not so
much as the remembrance of them upon my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then, as it seems, sometimes you got
rid of your trouble?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Yes, verily, but it would come into my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
mind again, and then I should be as bad, nay,
worse than I was before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Why, what was it that brought your
sins to mind again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Many things; as,</p>

<p>
1. If I did but meet a good man in the streets; or,<br />
<br />
2. If I have heard any read in the Bible; or,<br />
<br />
3. If mine head did begin to ache; or,<br />
<br />
4. If I were told that some of my neighbors<br />
were sick; or,<br />
<br />
5. If I heard the bell toll for some that were<br />
dead; or,<br />
<br />
6. If I thought of dying myself; or,<br />
<br />
7. If I heard that sudden death happened to<br />
others;<br />
<br />
8. But especially when I thought of myself that<br />
I must quickly come to judgment.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> And could you at any time with ease
get off the guilt of sin, when by any of these ways
it came upon you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> No, not I; for then they got faster hold
of my conscience; and then, if I did but think of
going back to sin (though my mind was turned
against it,) it would be double torment to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> And how did you do then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> I thought I must endeavor to mend my
life; for else, thought I, I am sure to be lost
forever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> And did you endeavor to mend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Yes, and fled from not only my sins, but
sinful company too, and betook me to religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
duties, as praying, reading, weeping for sin,
speaking truth to my neighbors, etc. These
things did I, with many others, too much here
to tell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> And did you think yourself well then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Yes, for a while; but, at the last, my
trouble came tumbling upon me again, and that
over the neck of all my trying to do right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> How came that about, since you were
now doing right, as far as you knew?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> There were several things brought it
upon me; especially such sayings as these: "All
our righteousness are as filthy rags;" "By the
works of the law shall no flesh be made righteous;"
"When ye shall have done all those things which
are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable;"
with many more such like. From whence I began
to reason with myself thus: If all my righteousness
are filthy rags, if by the deeds of the law no
man can be made righteous, and if, when we have
done <i>all</i>, we are yet unprofitable, then it is but a
folly to think of heaven by the law. I further
thought thus; If a man runs a hundred pounds
into the shopkeeper's debt, and after that shall
pay for all that he shall buy; yet his old debt
stands still in the book uncrossed; for the which
the shopkeeper may sue him, and cast him into
prison till he shall pay the debt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Well, and how did you apply this to
yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Why, I thought thus with myself: I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
have by my sins run a great way into God's book,
and my now reforming will not pay off that score.
Therefore I should think still, under all my present
trying. But how shall I be freed from that
punishment that I have brought myself in danger
of by my former sins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> A very good application; but pray go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Another thing that hath troubled me
ever since my late turning from sin is, that if I
look narrowly into the best of what I do now,
I still see sin, new sin, mixing itself with the best
of that I do; so that now I am forced to conclude
that, notwithstanding my former fond opinion of
myself and duties, I have committed sin enough
in one duty to send me to hell, though my former
life had been faultless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> And what did you do then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Do! I could not tell what to do, till
I brake my mind to Faithful; for he and I were
well acquainted. And he told me, that unless
I could obtain the righteousness of a Man that
never had sinned, neither mine own nor all the
righteousness of the world could save me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> And did you think he spake true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Had he told me so when I was pleased
and satisfied with mine own trying, I had called
him fool for his pains; but now, since I see mine
own weakness and the sin which cleaves to my
best performance, I have been forced to be of his
opinion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> But did you think, when at first he suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
it to you, that there was such a Man to be
found, of whom it might justly be said that He
never committed sin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> I must confess the words at first sounded
strangely; but after a little more talk and company
with him I had full certainty about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> And did you ask him what Man this was,
and how you must be made righteous by Him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Yes, and he told me it was the Lord
Jesus, that dwelleth on the right hand of the Most
High. And thus, said he, you must be made
right by Him, even by trusting what He hath done
by Himself in the days of His flesh, and suffered
when He did hang on the tree. I asked him
further, How that Man's righteousness could be of
that power to help another before God? And he
told me He was the mighty God, and did what He
did, and died the death also, not for Himself, but
for me; to whom His doings, and the worthiness
of them, should be given if I believed on Him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> And what did you do then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> I made my objections against my believing,
for that I thought He was not willing to
save me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> And what said Faithful to you then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> He bid me go to Him and see. Then I
said it was too much for me to ask for. But he
said No, for I was invited to come. Then he gave
me a book of Jesus' own writing to encourage me
the more freely to come; and he said concerning
that book, that every word and letter thereof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
stood firmer than heaven and earth. Then I
asked him what I must do when I came; and he
told me I must entreat on my knees, with all my
heart and soul, the Father to reveal Him to me.
Then I asked him further how I must make my
prayer to Him; and he said, Go, and thou shalt
find Him upon a mercy-seat, where He sits all the
year long to give pardon and forgiveness to them
that come. I told him that I knew not what to
say when I came; and he bid me say to this effect:
God be merciful to me a sinner, and make me to
know and believe in Jesus Christ; for I see that if
His righteousness had not been, or I have not
faith in that righteousness, I am utterly cast away.
Lord, I have heard that Thou art a merciful God,
and hast given that Thy Son Jesus Christ should
be the Saviour of the world; and, moreover, that
Thou art willing to bestow Him upon such a poor
sinner as I am. And I am a sinner indeed. Lord,
take therefore this opportunity, and show Thy
grace in the salvation of my soul, through Thy
Son Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> And did you do as you were bidden?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Yes, over, and over, and over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> And did the Father show His son to
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Not at the first, nor second, nor third,
nor fourth, nor fifth; no, nor at the sixth time
neither.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> What did you do then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> What! why, I could not tell what to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Had you no thoughts of leaving off
praying?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Yes; a hundred times twice told.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> And what was the reason you did not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> I believed that that was true which had
been told me; to wit, that without the righteousness
of this Christ, all the world could not save
me; and therefore, thought I with myself, if I
leave off I die, and I can but die at the throne of
grace. And withal, this came into my mind:
"Though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely
come, it will not tarry." So I continued praying
until the Father showed me His Son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> And how was He shown unto you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> I did not see Him with my bodily eyes,
but with the eyes of my heart, and thus it was:
One day I was very sad, I think sadder than at
any one time in my life; and this sadness was
through a fresh sight of the greatness and vileness
of my sins. And, as I was then looking for
nothing but hell and the everlasting loss of my
soul, suddenly, as I thought, I saw the Lord Jesus
look down from heaven upon me, and saying,
"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt
be saved."</p>

<p>But I replied, "Lord, I am a great, a very great
sinner." And He answered, "My grace is sufficient
for thee." Then I said, "But, Lord, what
is believing?" And then I saw from that saying,
"He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and
he that believeth on me shall never thirst," that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
believing and coming was all one; and that he
that came, that is, ran out in his heart and desire
after salvation by Christ, he indeed believed in
Christ. Then the water stood in mine eyes, and
I asked further, "But, Lord, may such a great
sinner as I am be indeed accepted of Thee, and be
saved by thee?" and I heard Him say, "And him
that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out."
Then said I, "But how Lord, must I consider of
Thee in my coming to Thee, that my faith may
be placed aright upon Thee?" Then he said,
"Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.
He is the end of the law for righteousness to
every one that believes. He died for our sins,
and rose again for our righteousness. He loved
us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood.
He is Mediator between God and us. He ever
liveth to plead for us." From all which I gathered
that I must look for righteousness in His person,
and for satisfaction for my sins by His blood; that
what He did in obedience to His Father's law, and
in submitting to the penalty thereof, was not for
Himself, but for him that will accept it for his
salvation, and be thankful. And now was my
heart full of joy, mine eyes full of tears, and mine
affections running over with love to the name,
people, and ways of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> This was a revelation of Christ to your
soul indeed. But tell me particularly what effect
this had upon your spirit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> It made me see that all the world, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
all the righteousness thereof, is in a
state of condemnation. It made me see that God
the Father, though He be just, can justly forgive
the coming sinner. It made me greatly ashamed
of the vileness of my former life, and confounded
me with the sense of my own ignorance; for there
never came thought into my heart before now,
that showed me so the beauty of Jesus Christ.
It made me love a holy life, and long to do something
for the honor and glory of the name of the
Lord Jesus. Yea, I thought that had I now a
thousand gallons of blood in my body, I could
spill it all for the sake of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>I saw then in my dream that Hopeful looked
back, and saw Ignorance, whom they had left
behind, coming after. "Look," said he to Christian,
"how far yonder youngster loitereth behind."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Ay, ay, I see him: he careth not for our
company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> But I think it would not have hurt him,
had he kept pace with us hitherto.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> That is true; but I warrant you he
thinks otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> That I think he doth; but, however, let
us tarry for him. So they did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Then Christian said to him, "Come
away, man; why do you stay so behind?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignor.</span> I take my pleasure in walking alone,
even more a great deal than in company, unless
I like it the better.</p>

<p>Then said Christian to Hopeful (but softly),
"Did I not tell you he cared not for our company?
But, however," said he, "come up, and let us talk
away the time in this solitary place." Then,
directing his speech to Ignorance, he said, "Come
how do you? How stands it between God and
your soul now?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignor.</span> I hope well; for I am always full of
good thoughts, that come into my mind to comfort
me as I walk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> What good motions? pray tell us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignor.</span> Why, I think of God and heaven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> So do the devils and lost souls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignor.</span> But I think of them and desire them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> So do many that are never like to come
there. "The soul of the sluggard desireth and
hath nothing."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignor.</span> But I think of them, and leave all for
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> That I doubt, for leaving of all is a very
hard matter; yea, a harder matter than many are
aware of. But why, or by what, art thou persuaded
that thou hast left all for God and
heaven?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignor.</span> My heart tells me so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> The Wise Man says, "He that trusteth
in his own heart is a fool."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignor.</span> This is spoken of an evil heart; but
mine is a good one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> But how dost thou prove that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignor.</span> It comforts me in the hopes of heaven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> That may be through its deceitfulness;
for a man's heart may minister comfort to him in
the hopes of that thing for which he has yet no
ground to hope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignor.</span> But my heart and life agree together;
and therefore my hope is well grounded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Who told thee that thy heart and life
agree together?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignor.</span> My heart tells me so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Ask my fellow if I be a thief! Thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
heart tells thee so! Except the Word of God
telleth thee in this matter, other testimony is of
no value.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignor.</span> But is it not a good heart that hath good
thoughts? and is not that a good life that is
according to God's commandments?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Yes, that is a good heart that hath good
thoughts, and that is a good life that is according
to God's commandments; but it is one thing,
indeed, to have these, and another thing only to
think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignor.</span> Pray, what count you good thoughts,
and a life according to God's commandments?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> There are good thoughts of many kinds:
some respecting ourselves, some God, some Christ,
and some other things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignor.</span> You go so fast, I cannot keep pace
with you. Do you go on before: I must stay
awhile behind.</p>

<p>Then they said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Well, Ignorance, wilt thou yet foolish be,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To slight good counsel, ten times given thee?</span><br />
<span class="i0">And if thou yet refuse it, thou shalt know,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ere long, the evil of thy doing so.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Remember, man, in time; stoop, do not fear;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Good counsel, taken well, saves; therefore hear:</span><br />
<span class="i0">But, if thou yet shalt slight it, thou wilt be</span><br />
<span class="i0">The loser, Ignorance, I'll warrant thee."</span>
</div>

<p>Then Christian addressed himself thus to his
fellow:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Well, come, my good Hopeful; I perceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
that thou and I must walk by ourselves
again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TWO PILGRIMS PROCEED</div>

<p>So I saw in my dream that they went on apace
before, and Ignorance he came hobbling after.
Then said Christian to his companion, "It pities
me much for this poor man: it will certainly go ill
with him at last."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Alas! there are abundance in our
town in his condition, whole families, yea,
whole streets, and that of pilgrims, too; and
if there be so many in our parts, how many,
think you, must there be in the place where he
was born?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Indeed, the Word saith, "He hath
blinded their eyes, lest they should see."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Well said; I believe you have said the
truth. Are we now almost got past the Enchanted
Ground?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Why, art thou weary of our talking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> No, verily; but that I would know
where we are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> We have not now above two miles
farther to go thereon. Well, we will leave at this
time our neighbor Ignorance by himself, and fall
upon another subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> With all my heart; but you shall still
begin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Well, then, did you not know, about
ten years ago, one Temporary in your parts, who
was a forward man in religion then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> Know him! yes; he dwelt in Graceless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
a town about two miles off of Honesty, and he
dwelt next door to one Turnback.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> Right, he dwelt under the same roof
with him. Well, that man was much awakened
once: I believe that then he had some sight of his
sins, and of the punishment that was due thereto.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope.</span> I am of your mind; for (my house not
being above three miles from him) he would ofttimes
come to me, and that with many tears.
Truly, I pitied the man, and was not altogether
without hope of him; but one may see, it is not
every one that cries "Lord! Lord!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chris.</span> He told me once that he was resolved
to go on pilgrimage as we do now; but all of a
sudden he grew acquainted with one Save-self,
and then he became a stranger to me, for at that
time he gave up going on pilgrimage.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class="sidenote">BEULAH LAND</div>
<p>Now I saw in my dream, that by this time
the pilgrims were got over the Enchanted
Ground, and entering into the country of
Beulah, whose air was very sweet and pleasant: the
way lying directly through it, they enjoyed themselves
there for a season. Yea, here they heard continually
the singing of birds and saw every day the
flowers appear on the earth, and heard the voice of
the turtle in the land. In this country the sun
shineth night and day; wherefore this was beyond
the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and also out
of the reach of Giant Despair; neither could they
from this place so much as see Doubting Castle.
Here they were within sight of the City they were
going to; also here met them some of the inhabitants
thereof; for in this land the Shining Ones
commonly walked, because it was upon the
borders of heaven. Here they had no want of
corn and wine; for in this place they met with
abundance of what they had sought for in all
their pilgrimage. Here they heard voices from
out of the City, loud voices, saying, "Say ye to
the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation
cometh! Behold, His reward is with Him!"
Here all the inhabitants of the country called
them "The holy people, and redeemed of the
Lord, sought out," etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>Now, as they walked in this land, they had
more rejoicing than in parts more remote from
the kingdom to which they were bound; and
drawing near to the City, they had yet a more
perfect view thereof. It was builded of pearls
and precious stones, also the streets thereof were
paved with gold; so that by reason of the natural
glory of the City, and the reflection of the sunbeams
upon it, Christian with desire fell sick;
Hopeful also had a fit or two of the same disease,
wherefore here they lay by it awhile, crying out
because of their pangs, "If you see my Beloved
tell Him that I am sick of love."</p>

<p>But being a little strengthened, and better able
to bear their sickness, they walked on their way,
and came yet nearer and nearer, where were
orchards, vineyards, and gardens, and their gates
opened into the highway. Now, as they came up
to these places, behold, the gardener, stood in the
way; to whom the pilgrims said, "Whose goodly
vineyards and gardens are these?" He answered,
"They are the King's, and are planted here for
His own delight, and also for the solace of pilgrims."
So the gardener had them into the vineyards,
and bid them refresh themselves with the
dainties. He also showed them there the King's
walks, and the arbors where He delighted to be;
and here they tarried and slept.</p>

<p>Now I beheld in my dream, that they talked
more in their sleep at this time than ever they did
in all their journey; and being in thought thereabout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the gardener said even to me, "Wherefore
dost thou meditate at the matter? It is the
nature of the fruit of the grapes of these vineyards
to go down so sweetly as to cause the lips of them
that are asleep to speak."</p>

<p>So I saw, when they awoke they undertook to
go up to the City. But, as I said, the reflection
of the sun upon the City (for the City was pure
gold) was so extremely glorious, that they could
not, as yet, with open face behold it, but through
a glass made for that purpose. So I saw that, as
they went on, there met them two men in raiment
that shone like gold, also their faces shone as the
light.</p>

<p>These men asked the pilgrims whence they
came; and they told them. They also asked
them where they had lodged, what difficulties and
dangers, what comforts and pleasures, they had
met in the way; and they told them. Then said
the men that met them, "You have but two difficulties
more to meet with, and then you are in
the City."</p>

<p>Christian, then, and his companion, asked the
men to go along with them; so they told them
that they would. "But," said they, "you must
obtain it by your own faith." So I saw in my
dream that they went on together till they came
in sight of the gate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A RIVER INTERVENES</div>

<p>Now I further saw, that betwixt them and the
gate was a river; but there was no bridge to go
over, and the river was very deep. At the sight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
therefore, of this river, the pilgrims were much
stunned; but the men that went with them said,
"You must go through, or you cannot come at
the gate."</p>

<p>The pilgrims then began to inquire if there was
no other way to the gate; to which they answered,
"Yes; but there hath not any save two, to wit,
Enoch and Elijah, been permitted to tread that
path since the foundation of the world, nor shall
until the last trumpet shall sound." The pilgrims
then, especially Christian, began to be
anxious in his mind, and looked this way and
that; but no way could be found by them by
which they might escape the river. Then they
asked the men if the waters were all of a depth.
They said, "No," yet they could not help them in
that case; "for," said they, "you shall find it
deeper or shallower as you believe in the King of
the place."</p>

<p>They then addressed themselves to the water;
and, entering, Christian began to sink, and crying
out to his good friend Hopeful, he said, "I sink in
deep waters; the billows go over my head; all His
waves go over me."</p>

<p>Then said the other, "Be of good cheer, my
brother; I feel the bottom, and it is good." Then
said Christian, "Ah! my friend, the sorrows of
death have compassed me about; I shall not see
the land that flows with milk and honey." And
with that, a great darkness and horror fell upon
Christian, so that he could not see before him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Also here he in a great measure lost his senses, so
that he could neither remember nor orderly talk
of any of those sweet refreshments that he had
met with in the way of his pilgrimage. But all
the words that he spake still tended to show that
he had horror of mind, and heart-fears that he
should die in that river, and never obtain entrance
in at the gate. Here also, as they that stood by
perceived, he was much in the troublesome
thoughts of the sins that he had committed, both
since and before he began to be a pilgrim. It was
also observed that he was troubled with the sight
of demons and evil spirits; for ever and anon
he would intimate so much by words.</p>

<p>Hopeful, therefore, here had much ado to keep
his brother's head above water; yea, sometimes
he would be quite gone down, and then, ere a while
he would rise up again half dead. Hopeful would
also endeavor to comfort him, saying, "Brother,
I see the gate, and men standing by to receive us;"
but Christian would answer, "It is you, it is you
they wait for: you have been hopeful ever since
I knew you." "And so have you," said he to
Christian. "Ah, brother," said he, "surely, if I
were right, He would now arise to help me; but
for my sins He hath brought me into this snare,
and hath left me." Then said Hopeful, "My
brother, these troubles and distresses that you go
through in these waters are no sign that God hath
forsaken you; but are sent to try you, whether
you will call to mind that which hitherto you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
have received of His goodness, and live upon Him
in your distresses."</p>

<p>Then I saw in my dream that Christian was in
thought awhile. To whom also Hopeful added
these words, "Be of good cheer, Jesus Christ
maketh thee whole." And, with that, Christian
brake out with a loud voice, "Oh, I see Him again;
and He tells me, 'When thou passest through the
waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers,
they shall not overflow thee.'" Then they both
took courage; and the enemy was, after that, as
still as a stone, until they were gone over. Christian,
therefore, presently found ground to stand
upon; and so it followed that the rest of the river
was but shallow. Thus they got over.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TWO SHINING MEN</div>

<p>Now, upon the bank of the river, on the other
side, they saw the two Shining Men again, who
there waited for them. Wherefore, being come
out of the river, they saluted them, saying, "We
are heavenly spirits, sent forth to help those that
shall be heirs of salvation." Thus they went
along towards the gate. Now, you must note that
the City stood upon a mighty hill; but the pilgrims
went up that hill with ease, because they
had these two men to lead them up by the arms;
also they had left their mortal garments behind
them in the river; for though they went in with
them, they came out without them. They therefore
went up here with much activity and speed,
though the foundation upon which the City was
framed was higher than the clouds. They therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
went up through the regions of the air, sweetly
talking as they went, being comforted because
they had safely got over the river, and had such
glorious companions to attend them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUNT ZION</div>

<p>The talk they had with the Shining Ones, was
about the glory of the place; who told them that
the beauty and glory of it were such as could not
be put into words. "There," said they, "is the
Mount Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem, the innumerable
company of angels, and the spirits of good
men made perfect. You are going now," said
they, "to the Paradise of God, wherein you shall
see the tree of life, and eat of the never-fading
fruits thereof; and when you come there, you
shall have white robes given you, and your walk
and talk shall be every day with the King, even
all the days of an eternal life. There you shall
not see again such things as you saw when you
were in the lower region upon the earth; to wit,
sorrow, sickness, affliction, and death; 'for the
former things are passed away.' You are going
now to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and to
the prophets, men that God hath taken away from
the evil to come, and that are now resting upon
their beds, each one walking in his righteousness."
The men then asked, "What must we do in the
holy place?" To whom it was answered, "You
must there receive the comfort of all your toil, and
have joy for all your sorrow; you must reap what
you have sown, even the fruit of all your prayers,
and tears, and sufferings for the King by the way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
In that place you must wear crowns of gold, and
enjoy the perpetual sight and visions of the Holy
One; for there you shall see Him as He is. There
also you shall serve Him continually with praise,
with shouting and thanksgiving, whom you desired
to serve in the world, though with much difficulty,
because of the weakness of your bodies. There
your eyes shall be delighted with seeing and your
ears with hearing the pleasant voice of the Mighty
One. There you shall enjoy your friends again
that are gone thither before you; and there you
shall with joy receive even every one that follows
into the holy place after you. There also you
shall be clothed with glory and majesty, and put
into a state fit to ride out with the King of Glory.
When He shall come with sound of trumpet in
the clouds, as upon the wings of the wind, you
shall come with Him; and when He shall sit upon
the throne of judgment, you shall sit by Him;
yea, and when He shall pass sentence upon all the
workers of evil, let them be angels or men, you also
shall have a voice in that judgment because they
were His and your enemies. Also, when He shall
again return to the City, you shall go too, with
sound of trumpet, and be ever with Him."</p>

<p>Now, while they were thus drawing towards
the gate, behold, a company of the heavenly host
came out to meet them; to whom it was said by
the other two Shining Ones, "These are the men
that have loved our Lord when in the world, and
that have left all for His holy name; and He hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
sent us to fetch them, and we have brought them
thus far on their desired journey, that they may
go in and look their Redeemer in the face with
joy." Then the heavenly host gave a great shout,
saying, "Blessed are they which are called to the
marriage supper of the Lamb." There came out
also at this time to meet them several of the King's
trumpeters, clothed in white and shining raiment
who, with melodious noises and loud, made even
the heavens to echo with their sound. These
trumpeters saluted Christian and his fellow with
ten thousand welcomes from the world; and this
they did with shouting and sound of trumpet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CELESTIAL CITY</div>

<p>This done, they compassed them round on
every side; some went before, some behind, and
some on the right hand, some on the left (as it
were to guard them through the upper regions),
continually sounding as they went, with melodious
noise, in notes on high: so that the very sight was
to them that could behold it as if heaven itself was
come down to meet them. Thus, therefore, they
walked on together; and, as they walked, ever
and anon these trumpeters, even with joyful
sound, would, by mixing their music, with looks
and gestures, still signify to Christian and his
brother how welcome they were into their company,
and with what gladness they came to meet
them. And now were these two men as it were
in heaven before they came at it, being swallowed
up with the sight of angels, and with hearing of
their melodious notes. Here also they had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
City itself in view, and thought they heard all the
bells therein to ring, and welcome them thereto.
But, above all, the warm and joyful thoughts
that they had about their own dwelling there with
such company, and that for ever and ever, oh! by
what tongue or pen can their glorious joy be
expressed?</p>

<p>And thus they came up to the gate. Now, when
they were come up to the gate, there was written
over it in letters of gold, "<span class="smcap">Blessed are they that
do His commandments, that they may have
right to the tree of life, and may enter in
through the gates into the city.</span>"</p>

<p>Then I saw in my dream, that the Shining Men
bid them call at the gate: the which when they
did, some from above looked over the gate: such
as Enoch, Moses, and Elijah, and others, to whom
it was said, "These pilgrims are come from the
City of Destruction, for the love that they bear to
the King of this place." And then the pilgrims
gave in unto them each man his certificate, which
they had received in the beginning; those therefore
were carried in to the King, who, when He
had read them, said, "Where are the men?" To
whom it was answered, "They are standing without
the gate." The King then commanded to
open the gate, "that the righteous nation," said
He, "which keepeth the truth, may enter in."</p>

<p>Now, I saw in my dream, that these two men
went in at the gate; and lo! as they entered, their
looks were changed so that their faces became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
bright; and they had garments put on that shone
like gold. There were also that met them with
harps and crowns, and gave them to them&mdash;the
harps to praise withal, and the crowns in token of
honor. Then I heard in my dream that all the
bells in the City rang again for joy, and that it was
said unto them, "Enter ye into the joy of your
Lord." I also heard the men themselves, that
they sang with a loud voice, saying, "Blessing,
and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him
that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb,
for ever and ever!"</p>

<p>Now, just as the gates were opened to let in the
men, I looked in after them, and behold, the City
shone like the sun; the streets also were paved
with gold; and in them walked many men with
crowns on their heads, palms in their hands, and
golden harps to sing praises withal.</p>

<p>There were also of them that had wings, and
they answered one another without ceasing, saying,
"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord!" And, after
that, they shut up the gates; which when I had
seen, I wished myself among them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IGNORANCE FAILS TO ENTER</div>

<p>Now while I was gazing upon all these things,
I turned my head to look back, and saw Ignorance
come up to the river-side; but he soon got over,
and that without half the difficulty which the
other two men met with. For it happened that
there was then in the place one Vain-Hope, a
ferryman, that with his boat helped him over; so
he, as the others I saw, did ascend the hill, to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
up to the gate; only he came alone, neither did
any man meet him with the least encouragement.
When he was come up to the gate, he looked up to
the writing that was above, and then began to
knock, supposing that entrance should have been
quickly given to him; but he was asked by the
men that looked over the top of the gate, "Whence
came you? and what would you have?" He
answered, "I have eaten and drunk in the presence
of the King, and He has taught in our streets."
Then they asked him for his certificate, that they
might go in and show it to the King: so he
fumbled in his bosom for one, and found none.
Then said they, "Have you none?" But the man
answered never a word. So they told the King;
but He would not come down to see him, but
commanded the two Shining Ones that conducted
Christian and Hopeful to the City, to go out and
take Ignorance, and bind him hand and foot, and
have him away. Then they took him up, and
carried him through the air to the door that I saw
in the side of the hill, and put him in there.
Then I saw that there was a way to hell, even
from the gates of heaven, as well as from the City
of Destruction!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Courteous Companions,&mdash;</span></h3>

<p>Some time since, to tell you my dream that I
had of Christian the Pilgrim, and of his dangerous
journey towards the Celestial
Country, was pleasant to me and profitable to
you. I told you then, also, what I saw concerning
his wife and children, and how unwilling they
were to go with him on pilgrimage, insomuch
that he was forced to go on his progress without
them; for he durst not run the danger of that
destruction which he feared would come by staying
with them in the City of Destruction; wherefore,
as I then showed you, he left them and
departed.</p>

<p>Now, it hath so happened, through the abundance
of business, that I have been much hindered
and kept back from my wonted travels into those
parts whence he went, and so could not, till now,
obtain an opportunity to make further inquiry
after those whom he left behind, that I might
give you an account of them. But, having had
some concerns that way of late, I went down
again thitherward. Now, having taken up my
lodgings in a wood about a mile off the place, as
I slept I dreamed again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE AUTHOR AND MR. SAGACITY</div>

<p>And as I was in my dream, behold, an aged
gentleman came by where I lay; and, because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
was to go some part of the way that I was travelling,
methought I got up and went with him.
So, as we walked, and as travelers usually do,
I was as if we fell into discourse; and our talk
happened to be about Christian and his travels;
for thus I began with the old man:</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, "what town is that there below,
that lieth on the left hand of our way?"</p>

<p>Then said Mr. Sagacity (for that was his name),
"It is the City of Destruction; a populous place,
but possessed with a very ill-conditioned and idle
sort of people."</p>

<p>"I thought that was that city," quoth I: "I
went once myself through that town, and therefore
know that this report you give of it is true."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sag.</span> Too true! I wish I could speak truth in
speaking better of them that dwell therein.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," quoth I, "then I perceive you to be
a well-meaning man, and so one that takes pleasure
to hear and tell of that which is good. Pray,
did you never hear what happened to a man some
time ago of this town (whose name was Christian),
that went on pilgrimage up towards the higher
regions?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sag.</span> Hear of him! Ay, and I also heard of the
difficulties, troubles, wars, captivities, cries, groans,
frights and fears that he met with and had in his
journey. Besides, I must tell you all our country
rings of him: there are but few houses that have
heard of him and his doings but have sought after
and got the record of his pilgrimage. Yea, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
think I may say that his hazardous journey has
got many wellwishers to his ways; for though,
when he was here, he was a fool in every man's
mouth, yet now he is gone he is highly commended
of all. For 'tis said he lives bravely where he is:
yea, many of them that are resolved never to run
his risks yet have their mouths water at his gains.</p>

<p>"They may," quoth I, "well think, if they think
anything that is true, that he liveth well where he
is; for he now lives at and in the Fountain of Life,
and has what he has without labor and sorrow;
for there is no grief mixed therewith. But, pray,
what talk have the people about him?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sag.</span> Talk! the people talk strangely about
him: some say that he now walks in white; that
he has a chain of gold about his neck; that he has
a crown of gold beset with pearls upon his head.
Others say that the Shining Ones, that sometimes
showed themselves unto him in his journey, are
become his companions, and that he is as familiar
with them in the place where he is, as here one
neighbor is with another. Besides, it is confidently
spoken concerning him, that the King of the
place where he is has bestowed upon him already
a very rich and pleasant dwelling at court, and
that he every day eateth and drinketh and walketh
with Him, and receiveth of the smiles and
favors of Him that is judge of all there. Moreover,
it is expected of some, that his Prince, the
Lord of that country, will shortly come into these
parts, and will know the reason, if they can give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
any, why his neighbors set so little by him, and
had him so much in derision, when they perceived
that he would be a Pilgrim. For they say,
now he is so in the affections of his Prince, and
that his Sovereign is so much concerned with the
wrongs that were cast upon Christian when he
became a Pilgrim, that He will look upon all as
if done unto Himself; and no marvel, for it was
for the love that he had to his Prince that he
ventured as he did.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SAGACITY TELLS OF CHRISTIANA</div>

<p>"I daresay," quoth I; "I am glad on't; I am
glad for the poor man's sake, for that he now has
rest from his labor, and for that he reapeth the
benefit of his tears with joy, and for that he has
got beyond gunshot of his enemies, and is out of
the reach of them that hate him. I also am glad
for that a rumor of these things is noised abroad
in this country: who can tell but that it may work
some good effect on some that are left behind?
But pray, sir, while it is fresh in my mind, do you
hear anything of his wife and children? Poor
hearts! I wonder in my mind what they do."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sag.</span> Who? Christiana and her sons? They
are like to do as well as did Christian himself; for,
though they all played the fool at first, and would
by no means be persuaded by either the tears or
entreaties of Christian, yet, second thoughts have
wrought wonderfully with them, so they have
packed up, and are also gone after him.</p>

<p>"Better and better," quoth I: "but, what!
wife and children and all?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span><span class="smcap">Sag.</span> It is true: I can give you an account of the
matter, for I was upon the spot at the instant, and
was thoroughly acquainted with the whole affair.</p>

<p>"Then," said I, "a man, it seems, may report
it for a truth?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sag.</span> You need not fear to declare it. I mean,
that they are all gone on pilgrimage, both the
good woman and her four boys. And, since (we
are, as I perceive) going some considerable way
together, I will give you an account of the whole
matter.</p>

<p>This Christiana (for that was her name from
the day that she, with her children betook themselves
to a pilgrim's life) after her husband had
gone over the river, and she could hear of him no
more, her thoughts began to work in her mind.
First, for that she had lost her husband, and of
that the loving bond of that relation was utterly
broken betwixt them. For you know (said he to
me) it is only natural that the living should have
many sad thoughts, in the remembrance of the
loss of loving relations. This, therefore, of her
husband, did cost her many a tear. But this was
not all; for Christiana did also begin to consider
with herself, whether unbecoming behavior towards
her husband was not one cause that she
saw him no more, and that in such sort he was
taken away from her. And, upon this, came into
her mind, by swarms, all her unkind, unnatural,
and ungodly treatment of her dear friend; which
also troubled her conscience, and did load her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
guilt. She was, moreover, much broken with
recalling to remembrance the restless groans,
brinish tears, and self-bemoanings of her husband,
and how she did harden her heart against all his
entreaties and loving persuasions of her and her
sons to go with him; yea, there was not anything
that Christian either said to her or did before her,
all the while that his burden did hang on his back,
but it returned upon her like a flash of lightning,
and rent her heart in sunder. Specially that
bitter outcry of his, "What shall I do to be saved?"
did ring in her ears most dolefully.</p>

<p>Then said she to her children, "Sons, we are all
undone. I have sinned away your father, and
he is gone; he would have had us with him, but I
would not go myself; I also have hindered you
of life."</p>

<p>With that, the boys fell all into tears, and cried
out to go after their father.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Christiana, "that it had been but
our lot to go with him! then had it fared well with
us, beyond what it is like to do now. For though
I formerly foolishly imagined, concerning the
troubles of your father, that they came from a
foolish fancy that he had, or for that he was
overrun with melancholy humors; yet now it will
not out of my mind but that they sprang from
another cause; and it was this, that the
light of life was given him, by the help of
which, as I perceive, he has escaped the snares
of death."</p>

<div class="sidenote">OF CHRISTIANA'S DREAM</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>Then they all wept again, and cried out, "Oh,
woe worth the day!"</p>

<p>The next night Christiana had a dream; and,
behold, she saw as if a broad parchment were
opened before her, in which were recorded the
sum of her ways; and the times, as she thought,
looked very black upon her. Then she cried out
aloud in her sleep, "Lord, have mercy upon me a
sinner!" and the little children heard her.</p>

<p>After this, she thought she saw two very ill-favored
ones standing by her bed-side, and saying,
"What shall we do with this woman? for she
cries out for mercy waking and sleeping: if she
be suffered to go on as she begins, we shall lose her
as we have lost her husband. Wherefore we must,
by one way or other, seek to take her off from
the thoughts of what shall be hereafter; else, all
the world cannot help but she will become a
pilgrim."</p>

<p>Now she awoke in a great sweat; also a trembling
was upon her; but after a while, she fell to
sleeping again. And then she thought she saw
Christian her husband in a place of bliss, among
many immortals, with a harp in his hand, standing
and playing upon it before One that sat upon a
throne, with a rainbow about His head.</p>

<p>She saw, also, as if he bowed his head with his
face to the paved work that was under the Prince's
feet, saying, "I heartily thank my Lord and King
for bringing of me into this place." Then shouted
a company of them that stood round about, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
harped with their harps; but no man living could
tell what they said, but Christian and his companions.</p>

<p>Next morning, when she was up, and had
prayed to God and talked with her children a
while, one knocked hard at the door; to whom
she spake out, saying, "If thou comest in God's
name, come in." So he said, "Amen," and
opened the door, and saluted her with "Peace be
to this house!" The which, when he had done,
he said, "Christiana, knowest thou wherefore I
am come?" Then she blushed and trembled,
also her heart began to wax warm with desires to
know from whence he came, and what was his
errand to her. So he said unto her, "My name is
Secret: I dwell with those that are on high. It
is talked of where I dwell, as if thou hadst a desire
to go thither; also there is a report that thou art
aware of the evil thou hast formerly done to thy
husband, in hardening thy heart against his way,
and in keeping of these thy babes in their ignorance.
Christiana, the Merciful One hath sent me
to tell thee, that He is a God ready to forgive, and
that He taketh delight to pardon offences. He
also would have thee know that He inviteth thee
to come into His presence, to His table, and that
He will feed thee with the fat of His house, and
with the heritage of Jacob thy father.</p>

<p>"There is Christian, thy husband that was, with
legions more, his companions, ever behold that
face that doth minister life to beholders; and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
will be glad when they shall hear the sound of thy
feet step over thy Father's threshold."</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTIANA IS SENT FOR</div>

<p>Christiana at this was greatly abashed in herself,
and bowed her head to the ground.</p>

<p>This visitor proceeded, and said, "Christiana,
here is also a letter for thee, which I have brought
from thy husband's King." So she took it, and
opened it; but it smelt after the manner of the
best perfume; also it was written in letters of gold.
The contents of the letter were these: "That the
King would have her to do as Christian her husband;
for that was the way to come to His City,
and to dwell in His presence with joy for ever."</p>

<p>At this the good woman was quite overcome;
so she cried out to her visitor, "Sir, will you carry
me and my children with you, that we also may
worship this King?"</p>

<p>Then said the visitor, "Christiana, the bitter
is before the sweet. Thou must through troubles,
as did he that went before thee, enter the Celestial
City. Wherefore I advise thee to do as did
Christian thy husband: go to the wicket-gate
yonder over the plain, for that stands in the head
of the way up which you must go; and I wish thee
all good speed. Also I advise that thou put
this letter in thy bosom, that thou read therein to
thyself, and to thy children, until you have got it
by rote of heart: for it is one of the songs that
thou must sing while thou art in this house of thy
pilgrimage. Also this thou must deliver in at the
farther gate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>Now, I saw in my dream, that this old gentleman,
as he told me the story, did himself seem
to be greatly affected therewith. He moreover
went on, and said:</p>

<p>So Christiana called her sons together, and
began thus to address herself unto them: "My
sons, I have, as you may perceive, been of late
under much trouble in my soul about the death
of your father: not for that I doubt at all of his
happiness, for I am satisfied now that he is well.
I have also been much affected with the thoughts
of mine own state and yours, which I verily believe
is by nature miserable. My treatment also of
your father in his distress is a great load to my
conscience, for I hardened both mine own heart
and yours against him, and refused to go with
him on pilgrimage.</p>

<p>"The thoughts of these things would now kill
me outright, but for a dream which I had last
night, and but for the encouragement that this
stranger has given me this morning. Come, my
children, let us pack up, and be gone to the gate
that leads to the Celestial Country, that we may
see your father, and be with him and his companions
in peace, according to the laws of that land."</p>

<p>Then did her children burst out into tears, for
joy that the heart of their mother was so inclined.
So their visitor bade them farewell; and they
began to prepare to set out for their journey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MRS. TIMOROUS AND CHRISTIANA</div>

<p>But while they were thus about to be gone, two
of the women that were Christiana's neighbors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
came up to the house, and knocked at the door.
To whom she said as before, "if you come in God's
name, come in." At this the women were stunned;
for this kind of language they used not to hear, or
to perceive to drop from the lips of Christiana.
Yet they came in; but, behold they found the
good woman preparing to be gone from her house.</p>

<p>So they began, and said, "Neighbor, pray what
is your meaning by this?"</p>

<p>Christiana answered and said to the eldest of
them, whose name was Mrs. Timorous, "I am
preparing for a journey."</p>

<p>This Timorous was daughter to him that met
Christian upon the Hill Difficulty, and would have
had him go back for fear of the lions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> For what journey, I pray you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Even to go after my good husband. And
with that she fell a weeping.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> I hope not so, good neighbor. Pray, for
your poor children's sake, do not so unwomanly
cast away yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Nay, my children shall go with me; not
one of them is willing to stay behind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> I wonder in my very heart what or who
has brought you into this mind!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Oh, neighbor, knew you but as much as I
do, I doubt not but that you would go with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> Prithee, what new knowledge hast thou
got that so worketh off thy mind from thy friends,
and that tempteth thee to go nobody knows
where?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Then Christiana replied, "I have been
sorely afflicted since my husband's departure from
me, but especially since he went over the river.
But that which troubleth me most is my unkind
treatment of him when he was under his distress.
Besides, I am now as he was then: nothing will
serve me but going on pilgrimage. I was a-dreaming
last night that I saw him. Oh that my soul
was with him! He dwelleth in the presence of
the King of the country; he sits and eats with
Him at His table; he has become a companion of
immortals, and has a house now given him to
dwell in, to which the best palaces on earth, if
compared, seem to me but as a dunghill. The
Prince of the place has also sent for me, with
promises of entertainment if I shall come to Him;
His messenger was here even now, and has brought
me a letter which invites me to come." And with
that she plucked out the letter, and read it, and
said to them, "What now will you say to this?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">MERCY ALSO DESIRES TO GO</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> Oh, the madness that hath possessed thee
and thy husband, to run yourselves upon such
difficulties! You have heard, I am sure, what your
husband did meet with, even in a manner at
the first step that he took on his way, as our
neighbor Obstinate can yet testify, for he went
along with them, yea, and Pliable too; until they,
like wise men, were afraid to go any farther.
We also heard, over and above, how he met
with the lions, Apollyon, the Shadow of Death,
and many other things. Nor is the danger he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
met with at Vanity Fair to be forgotten by thee.
For if he, though a man, was so hard put to it,
what canst thou, being but a poor woman, do?
Consider also that these four sweet babes are thy
children, thy flesh and thy bones. Wherefore,
though thou shouldest be so rash as to cast away
thyself, yet, for the sake of thy children, keep
thou at home.</p>

<p>But Christiana said unto her, "Tempt me not,
my neighbor. I have now a price put into
my hands to get gain, and I should be a fool of
the greatest size if I should have no heart to strike
in with the opportunity. And for that you tell
me of all these troubles which I am like to meet
with in the way, they are so far off from being
to me a discouragement, that they show I am in
the right. The bitter must come before the
sweet, and that also will make the sweet the sweeter.
Wherefore, since you came not to my house
in God's name, as I said, I pray you to be gone,
and not to disquiet me further."</p>

<p>Then Timorous reviled her, and said to her
fellow, "Come, neighbor Mercy, let us leave her
in her own hands, since she scorns our counsel
and company." But Mercy was at a stand, and
could not so readily comply with her neighbor,
and that for a twofold reason. 1. Her heart
yearned over Christiana; so she said within herself,
"If my neighbor will needs be gone, I will go
a little way with her, and help her." 2. Her heart
yearned over her own soul; for what Christiana<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
had said had taken hold upon her mind. Wherefore
she said within herself again, "I will yet have
more talk with this Christiana, and if I find truth
and life in what she shall say, myself, with my
heart, shall also go with her." Wherefore Mercy
began thus to reply to her neighbor Timorous:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Neighbor, I did indeed come with you to
see Christiana this morning; and since she is,
as you see, taking her last farewell of her country,
I think to walk this sunshiny morning a little
with her, to help her on her way.</p>

<p>But she told her not of the second reason, but
kept that to herself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> Well, I see you have a mind to go a-fooling
too; but take heed in time, and be wise. While
we are out of danger, we are out; but when we
are in, we are in.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Timorous returned to her house, and
Christiana betook herself to her journey. But
when Timorous was got home to her house, she
sends for some of her neighbors; to wit, Mrs.
Bat's-eyes, Mrs. Inconsiderate, Mrs. Light-mind,
and Mrs. Know-nothing. So, when they were
come to her house, she falls to telling of the story
of Christiana and of her intended journey. And
thus she began her tale:</p>

<div class="sidenote">MRS. TIMOROUS' NEIGHBORS</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> Neighbors, having had little to do this
morning, I went to give Christiana a visit; and
when I came at the door, I knocked, as you know
it is our custom; and she answered, "If you come
in God's name come in." So in I went, thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
all was well; but when I came in I found her
preparing herself to depart the town, she and also
her children. So I asked her what was her
meaning by that. And she told me, in short,
that she was now of a mind to go on pilgrimage,
as did her husband. She told me also a dream
that she had, and how the King of the country
where her husband was had sent her an inviting
letter to come thither.</p>

<p>Then said Mrs. Know-nothing, "And, what!
do you think she will go?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> Ay, go she will, whatever comes on't;
and methinks I know it by this: for that which
was my great reason in persuading her to stay at
home (that is, the troubles she was like to meet
with in the way) is one great reason with her to
put her forward on her journey. For she told
me, in so many words, "The bitter goes before the
sweet; yea, and forasmuch as it so doth, it makes
the sweet the sweeter."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bat's-eyes.</span> "Oh, this blind and foolish
woman!" said she; "will she not take warning
by her husband's trials? For my part, I see, if
he were here again, he would rest him content in
a whole skin, and never run so many dangers for
nothing."</p>

<p>Mrs. Inconsiderate also replied, saying, "Away
with such fantastical fools from the town! a
good riddance, for my part, I say, of her! Should
she stay where she dwells, and retain this her
mind, who could live quietly by her? for she will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
either be dumpish, or unneighborly, or talk of
such matters as no wise body can abide. Wherefore,
for my part, I shall never be sorry for her
departure: let her go, and let better come in her
room. It was never a good world since these
whimsical fools dwelt in it."</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Light-mind added as followeth:
"Come, put this kind of talk away. I was yesterday
at Madam Wanton's, where we were as
merry as the maids. For who do you think
should be there, but I and Mrs. Love-the-Flesh,
and three or four more, with Mr. Lechery, Mrs.
Filth, and some others. So there we had music
and dancing, and what else was meet to fill up the
pleasure. And, I dare say, my lady herself is
an admirable well-bred gentlewoman, and Mr.
Lechery is as pretty a fellow."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE WICKET-GATE.</h3>


<p>By this time Christiana was got on her way,
and Mercy went along with her. So as
they went, her children being there also,
Christiana began to discourse. "And, Mercy,"
said Christiana, "I take this as an unexpected
favor, that thou shouldest set forth out of doors
with me, to accompany me a little in my way."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Then said young Mercy (for she was but
young), "If I thought it would be a good purpose
to go with you, I would never go near the town
any more."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> "Well, Mercy," said Christiana, "cast in
thy lot with me: I well know what will be the end
of our pilgrimage: my husband is where he would
not but be for all the gold in the Spanish mines.
Nor shalt thou be turned away, though thou goest
but upon my invitation. The King who hath sent
for me and my children is One that delighteth in
mercy. Besides, if thou wilt, I will hire thee, and
thou shalt go along with me as my servant; yet
we will have all things in common betwixt thee
and me, only go along with me."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> But how shall I be sure that I also shall
be welcomed? Had I this hope but from one that
can tell, I would have no hesitation at all, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
would go, being helped by Him that can help,
though the way be never so tedious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Well, loving Mercy, I will tell thee what
thou shalt do: go with me to the wicket-gate, and
there I will further inquire for thee; and if there
thou dost not meet with encouragement, I will be
content that thou shalt return to thy place: I
also will pay thee for thy kindness which thou
showest to me and my children, in the accompanying
of us in our way as thou dost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MERCY GOES WITH CHRISTIANA</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Then will I go thither, and will take what
shall follow; and the Lord grant that my lot may
there fall, even as the King of heaven shall have
His heart upon me!</p>

<p>Christiana was then glad at her heart, not only
that she had a companion, but also for that she
had prevailed with this poor maid to fall in love
with her own salvation. So they went on together
and Mercy began to weep.</p>

<p>Then said Christiana, "Wherefore weepeth my
sister so?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> "Alas!" said she, "who can but lament,
that shall but rightly consider what a state and
condition my poor relations are in, that yet
remain in our sinful town? And that which
makes my grief the more heavy is, because they
have no one to teach them nor to tell them what
is to come."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Tenderness becometh pilgrims; and thou
dost for thy friends as my good Christian did for
me when he left me: he mourned for that I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
not heed nor regard him; but his Lord and ours
did gather up his tears, and put them into His
bottle; and now both I and thou, and these my
sweet babes, are reaping the fruit and benefit of
them I hope, Mercy, that these tears of thine will
not be lost; for the Truth hath said that "they
that sow in tears shall reap in joy," in singing;
and "he that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing
precious seed, shall doubtless come again with
rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him."</p>

<p>Then said Mercy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let the Most Blessd be my guide,</span><br />
<span class="i1">If 't be His blessd will,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Unto His gate, into His fold,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Up to His holy hill.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And never let Him suffer me</span><br />
<span class="i1">To swerve or turn aside</span><br />
<span class="i0">From His free grace and holy ways,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Whate'er shall me betide.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And let Him gather them of mine</span><br />
<span class="i1">That I have left behind:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lord, make them pray they may be Thine,</span><br />
<span class="i1">With all their heart and mind."</span>
</div> </div>

<p>Now my old friend proceeded, and said, "But
when Christiana came to the Slough of Despond,
she began to be at a stand; 'For,' said she, 'this
is the place in which my dear husband had like
to have been smothered with mud.' She perceived
also that, notwithstanding the command
of the King to make this place for pilgrims good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
yet it was rather worse than formerly." So I
asked if that was true.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old gentleman, "too true, for
many there be that pretend to be the King's
laborers, and say they are for mending the King's
highway, that bring dirt and dung instead of
stones, and so mar instead of mending. Here
Christiana, therefore, with her boys, did make a
stand. But said Mercy, 'Come, let us venture,
only let us be wary.' Then they looked well to
their steps, and made shift to get staggeringly
over. Yet Christiana had to have been in, and
that not once nor twice.</p>

<p>"Now, they had no sooner got over, but they
thought they heard words that said unto them,
'Blessed is she that believeth, for there shall be a
performance of those things which were told her
from the Lord.'</p>

<p>"Then they went on again; and said Mercy to
Christiana, 'Had I as good ground to hope for a
loving reception at the wicket-gate as you, I
think no Slough of Despond would discourage me.'</p>

<p>"'Well,' said the other, 'You know your
trouble, and I know mine; and, good friend, we
shall have enough evil before we come at our
journey's end. For can it be imagined that the
people that design to attain such excellent glories
as we do, and that are so envied that happiness
as we are, but that we shall meet with what fears,
with what troubles and afflictions they can possibly
assault us with, that hate us?'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">AT THE WICKET GATE</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>And now Mr. Sagacity left me to dream out
my dream by myself. Wherefore, methought
I saw Christiana, and Mercy, and the boys, go all
of them up to the gate; to which when they were
come they betook themselves to a short debate
about how they must manage their calling at the
gate, and what should be said unto him that did
open unto them: so it was concluded, since Christiana
was the eldest, that she should knock for entrance,
and that she should speak to him that did
open, for the rest. So Christiana began to knock,
and, as her poor husband did, she knocked and
knocked again. But instead of any that answered,
they all thought that they heard as if a dog came
barking upon them; a dog, and a great one too:
and this made the women and children afraid, nor
durst they for a while to knock any more, for fear
the mastiff should fly upon them. Now, therefore,
they were greatly tumbled up and down in their
minds, and knew not what to do. Knock they
durst not, for fear of the dog; go back they durst
not, for fear the keeper of the gate should espy
them as they so went, and should be offended
with them. At last they thought of knocking
again, and knocked more loudly than they did at
first. Then said the Keeper of the gate, "Who
is there?" So the dog left off to bark, and He
opened unto them.</p>

<p>Then Christiana made low obeisance, and said,
"Let not our Lord be offended with His handmaidens,
for that we have knocked at His princely gate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>Then said the Keeper, "Whence come ye? and
what is it that you would have?"</p>

<p>Christiana answered, "We are come from
whence Christian did come, and upon the same
errand as he; to wit, to be, if it shall please you,
graciously admitted by this gate into the way that
leads to the Celestial City. And I answer, my
Lord, in the next place, that I am Christiana,
once the wife of Christian, that now is gotten
above."</p>

<p>With that the Keeper of the gate did marvel,
saying, "What! is she now become a pilgrim, that,
but a while ago hated that life?"</p>

<p>Then she bowed her head, and said, "Yes;
and so are these my sweet babes also."</p>

<p>Then He took her by the hand, and let her in,
and said also, "Suffer the little children to come
unto me;" and with that He shut up the gate.
This done, He called to a trumpeter that was above,
over the gate, to entertain Christiana with shouting
and sound of trumpet for joy. So he obeyed,
and sounded, and filled the air with his melodious
notes.</p>

<p>Now, all this while poor Mercy did stand without
trembling and crying, for fear that she was
rejected. But when Christiana had got admittance
for herself and her boys, then she began to
make intercession for Mercy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MERCY FALLS IN A SWOON</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> And she said, "My Lord, I have a companion
of mine that stands yet without, that is
come hither upon the same account as myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
one that is much troubled in her mind, for that
she comes, as she thinks, without sending for;
whereas I was sent to by my husband's King to
come."</p>

<p>Now Mercy began to be very impatient, for
each minute was as long to her as an hour; wherefore
she prevented Christiana from asking for
her more fully by knocking at the gate herself.
And she knocked then so loud that she made
Christiana to start. Then said the Keeper of the
gate, "Who is there?" And said Christiana, "It is
my friend."</p>

<p>So He opened the gate and looked out; but
Mercy was fallen down without in a swoon, for
she fainted, and was afraid that no gate would be
opened to her.</p>

<p>Then he took her by the hand, and said,
"Maiden, I bid thee arise."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," said she, "I am faint: there is scarce
life left in me."</p>

<p>But He answered that "One once said, 'When
my soul fainted within me, I remembered the
Lord; and my prayer came in unto Thee, into
Thy holy temple.' Fear not, but stand upon thy
feet, and tell me wherefore thou art come."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> I am come for that unto which I was never
invited, as my friend Christiana was. Hers was
from the King, and mine was but from her.
Wherefore I fear I presume.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keep.</span> Did she desire thee to come with her
to this place?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Yes; and, as my Lord sees, I am come.
And if there is any grace and forgiveness of sins to
spare, I beseech that I, Thy poor handmaiden,
may be partaker thereof.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MERCY PERMITTED TO ENTER</div>

<p>Then He took her again by the hand, and led
her gently in, and said, "I pray for all them that
believe on me, by what means soever they come
unto me." Then said He to those that stood by,
"Fetch something, and give it to Mercy to smell
on, thereby to stay her fainting." So they
fetched her a bundle of myrrh, and a while after
she was revived.</p>

<p>And now was Christiana and her boys and Mercy
received of the Lord at the head of the way, and
spoke kindly unto by Him. Then said they yet
further unto Him, "We are sorry for our sins,
and beg of our Lord His pardon and further information
what we must do."</p>

<p>"I grant pardon," said He, "by word and deed:
by word, in the promise of forgiveness; by deed,
in the way I obtained it. Take the first from my
lips with a kiss, and the other as it shall be
revealed."</p>

<p>Now, I saw in my dream, that He spake many
good words unto them, whereby they were greatly
gladded. He also had them up to the top of the
gate, and showed them by what deed they were
saved; and told them withal that that sight they
would have again as they went along the way,
to their comfort.</p>

<p>So He left them a while in a summer parlor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
below, where they entered into a talk by themselves;
and thus Christiana began:</p>

<p>"O Lord, how glad am I that we are got in
hither!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> So you well may; but I of all have cause
to leap for joy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> I thought one time as I stood at the gate,
because I knocked, and none did answer, that
all our labor had been lost, specially when that
ugly cur made such a heavy barking against us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> But my worst fear was after I saw that
you were taken into His favor, and that I was left
behind. Now, thought I, it is fulfilled which is
written, "Two women shall be grinding at the
mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left."
I had much ado to forbear crying out, "Undone!
undone!" And afraid I was to knock any more:
but when I looked up to what was written over
the gate, I took courage. I also thought that I
must either knock again or die; so I knocked,
but I cannot tell how, for my spirit now struggled
betwixt life and death.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> Can you not tell how you knocked? I
am sure your knocks were so earnest, that the
very sound of them made me start. I thought I
never heard such knocking in all my life; I thought
you would come in by violent hands, or take the
kingdom by storm.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Alas! to be in my case, who that so was
could but have done so? You saw that the door
was shut upon me, and that there was a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
cruel dog thereabout. Who, I say, that was so
faint-hearted as I, would not have knocked with
all their might? But, pray, what said my
Lord to my rudeness? Was He not angry with
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> When He heard your lumbering noise,
He gave a wonderful innocent smile; I believe
what you did pleased Him well enough, for He
showed no sign to the contrary. But I marvel
in my heart why he keeps such a dog; had I
known that afore, I should not have had heart
enough to have ventured myself in this manner.
But now we are in, we are in, and I am glad
with all my heart.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> I will ask, if you please, next time He
comes down, why He keeps such a filthy cur in
His yard. I hope He will not take it amiss.</p>

<p>"Ay, do," said the children, "and persuade Him
to hang him, for we are afraid he will bite us when
we go hence."</p>

<p>So at last He came down to them again, and
Mercy fell to the ground on her face before Him,
and worshiped, and said, "Let my Lord accept
the offering of praise which I now offer unto Him
with my lips."</p>

<div class="sidenote">MERCY EXPRESSES HER FEARS</div>

<p>So He said unto her, "Peace be to thee; stand
up." But she continued upon her face, and said,
"Righteous art Thou, O Lord, when I plead with
Thee; yet let me talk with Thee of Thy judgments.
Wherefore dost Thou keep so cruel a dog in Thy
yard, at the sight of which such women and children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
as we are ready to fly from the gate with fear?"
He answered and said, "That dog has another
owner; he also is kept close in another man's
ground, only my pilgrims hear his barking: he
belongs to the castle which you see there at a distance,
but can come up to the walls of this place.
He has frighted many an honest pilgrim from
worse to better, by the great voice of his roaring.
Indeed, he that owneth him doth not keep him
out of any good-will to me or mine, but with
intent to keep the pilgrims from coming to me,
and that they may be afraid to come and knock
at this gate for entrance. Sometimes also he has
broken out, and has worried some that I love;
but I take all at present patiently. I also give
my pilgrims timely help, so that they are not
delivered up to his power, to do with them what
his doggish nature would prompt him to. But,
what! my beloved one, I should suppose, hadst
thou known even so much beforehand, thou
wouldst not have been afraid of a dog. The
beggars that go from door to door will, rather than
lose a supposed alms, run the danger of the bawling,
barking, and biting too, of a dog; and shall
a dog in another man's yard, a dog whose barking
I turn to the profit of pilgrims, keep any one from
coming to me? I deliver them from the lions,
their darling from the power of the dog."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Then said Mercy, "I confess my ignorance,
I spake what I understood not: I acknowledge
that Thou doest all things well."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Then Christiana began to talk of their
journey, and to inquire after the way.</p>

<p>So He fed them, and washed their feet, and set
them in the way of His steps, according as He had
dealt with her husband before.</p>

<p>So I saw in my dream that they walked on in
their way, and had the weather very comfortable
to them.</p>

<p>Then Christiana began to sing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Blessed be the day that I began</span><br />
<span class="i1">A pilgrim for to be;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And blessd also be the man</span><br />
<span class="i1">That thereto movd me.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis true 'twas long ere I began</span><br />
<span class="i1">To seek to live for ever;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But now I run fast as I can:</span><br />
<span class="i1">'Tis better late than never.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Our tears to joy, our fears to faith,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Are turnd, as we see;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thus our beginning (as one saith)</span><br />
<span class="i1">Shows what our end will be."</span>
</div></div>

<p>Now, there was, on the other side of the wall
that fenced in the way up which Christiana and
her companions were to go, a garden, and that
garden belonged to him whose was that barking
dog, of whom mention was made before. And
some of the fruit-trees that grew in that garden
shot their branches over the wall; and, being
mellow, they that found them did gather them up
and oft eat of them to their hurt. So Christiana's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
boys, as boys are apt to do, being pleased with the
trees, and the fruit that did hang thereon, did
bend the branches down, and pluck the fruit, and
begin to eat. Their mother did also chide them
for so doing; but still the boys went on.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">Christiana&#39;s Boys Began to Eat.<br />
<small>See page 231</small></span>
</div>

<p>"Well," said she, "my sons, you do wrong, for
that fruit is none of ours;" but she did not know
that it did belong to the enemy: I'll warrant you,
if she had, she would have been ready to die for
fear. But that passed, and they went on their
way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ILL-FAVORED ONES</div>

<p>Now, by that they were gone about two bow-shots
from the place that led them unto the way,
they espied two very ill-favored ones coming
down apace to meet them. With that, Christiana,
and Mercy her friend, covered themselves with
their veils, and so kept on their journey; the
children also went on before; so that, at last,
they met together. Then they that came down
to meet them came just up to the women, as if
they would embrace them; but Christiana said,
"Stand back, or go peaceably by, as you should."</p>

<p>Yet these two, as men that are deaf, regarded
not Christiana's words, but began to lay hands
upon them. At that, Christiana, waxing very
wroth, spurned at them with her feet. Mercy
also, as well as she could, did what she could to
shift them. Christiana again said to them,
"Stand back, and be gone; for we have no money
to lose, being pilgrims, as you see, and such, too,
as live upon the charity of our friends."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span><span class="smcap">Ill-favored One.</span> Then said one of the two
men, "We make no assault upon you for money,
but are come out to tell you that, if you will grant
one small request which we shall ask, we will make
women of you for ever."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Now Christiana, imagining what they
should mean, made answer again, "We will neither
hear nor regard, nor yield to what you shall ask.
We are in haste, and cannot stay; our business is
a business of life or death."</p>

<p>So again she and her companions made a fresh
attempt to go past them; but they letted them
in their way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ill-fav.</span> And they said, "We intend no hurt
to your lives; it is another thing we would have."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> "Ay," quoth Christiana, "you would have
us body and soul, for I know it is for that you are
come; but we will die rather upon the spot, than
to suffer ourselves to be brought into such snares
as shall risk the loss of our well-being hereafter."
And, with that, they both shrieked out, and cried,
"Murder! murder!" and so put themselves under
those laws that are provided for the protection of
women. But the men still made their approach
upon them, with design to prevail against them.
They therefore cried out again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A RELIEVER APPEARS</div>

<p>Now, they being, as I said, far from the gate
in at which they came, their voices were heard
from where they were, thither; wherefore some
of the house came out, and, knowing it was Christiana's
tongue, they made haste to her relief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
But by the time that they were got within sight
of them, the women were in a very great terror;
the children also stood crying by. Then did he
that came in for their relief call out to the ruffians,
saying, "What is that thing you do? Would you
make my Lord's people to do wrong?" He also
attempted to take them, but they did make their
escape over the wall into the garden of the man
to whom the great dog belonged; so the dog
became their protector. This Reliever then came
up to the women and asked them how they did.</p>

<p>So they answered, "We thank thy Prince,
pretty well, only we have been somewhat affrighted:
we thank thee also for that thou camest
in to our help, otherwise we had been overcome."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reliever.</span> So, after a few more words, this
Reliever said as followeth: "I marvelled much
when you were entertained at the gate above,
being ye knew that ye were but weak women,
that you asked not the Lord for a conductor.
Then might you have avoided these troubles and
dangers; for He would have granted you one."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> "Alas!" said Christiana, "we were taken
so with our present blessing, that dangers to
come were forgotten by us. Besides, who could
have thought that, so near the King's palace,
there could have lurked such naughty ones?
Indeed, it had been well for us had we asked our
Lord for one; but, since our Lord knew it would
be for our profit, I wonder He sent not one along
with us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span><span class="smcap">Rel.</span> It is not always necessary to grant things
not asked for, lest, by so doing, they become of
little value; but when the want of a thing is
felt, then he who needs it feels its preciousness;
and so when it is given it will be used. Had my
Lord granted you a conductor, you would not
either have so bewailed that oversight of yours,
in not asking for one, as now you have occasion
to do. So all things work for good, and tend to
make you more wary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Shall we go back again to my Lord, and
confess our folly, and ask one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rel.</span> Your confession of your folly I will
present Him with. To go back again you need
not; for, in all places where you shall come,
you will find no want at all; for, in every one of my
Lord's lodgings, which He has prepared for the
care of His pilgrims, there is sufficient to furnish
them against all attempts whatsoever. But,
as I said, He will be asked of by them, to do it for
them. And 'tis a poor thing that is not worth
asking for.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PILGRIMS PROCEED</div>

<p>When he had thus said, he went back to his
place, and the pilgrims went on their way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Then said Mercy, "What a sudden blank
is here! I made account we had been past all
danger, and that we should never see sorrow
more."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> "Thy innocence, my sister," said Christiana
to Mercy, "may excuse thee much; but
as for me, fault is so much the greater, for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
I saw the danger before I came out of the doors,
and yet did not provide for it when provision
might have been had. I am, therefore, much to
be blamed."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Then said Mercy, "How knew you this
before you came from home? Pray, open to me
this riddle."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Why, I will tell you. Before I set foot
out of doors, one night, as I lay in my bed, I had
a dream about this; for methought I saw two
men, as like these as ever any in the world could
look, stand at my bed's feet, plotting how they
might prevent my salvation. I will tell you
their very words. They said (it was when I was
in my troubles), "What shall we do with this
woman? for she cries out waking and sleeping
for forgiveness: if she be suffered to go on as she
begins, we shall lose her as we have lost her
husband." This, you know, might have made
me take heed, and have provided when provision
might have been had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> "Well," said Mercy, "as by this neglect
we have been made to behold our own imperfections,
so our Lord has taken occasion thereby
to make manifest the riches of His grace; for He,
as we see, has followed us with unasked kindness,
and has delivered us from their hands that were
stronger than we, of His mere good pleasure."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE INTERPRETER'S HOUSE.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">THE INTERPRETER'S HOUSE</div>


<p>Thus, now, when they had talked away a little
more time, they drew near to a house which
stood in the way, which house was built for
the relief of pilgrims, as you will find more fully
related in the first part of these records of the Pilgrim's
Progress. So they drew on towards the
house (the house of the Interpreter); and, when
they came to the door, they heard a great talk in
the house. Then they gave ear, and heard, as they
thought, Christiana mentioned by name; for you
must know that there went along, even before
her, a talk of her and her children's going on
pilgrimage. And this was the more pleasing to
them, because they had heard she was Christian's
wife, that woman who was some time ago so unwilling
to hear of going on pilgrimage. Thus,
therefore, they stood still, and heard the good
people within commending her, who, they little
thought, stood at the door. At last Christiana
knocked, as she had done at the gate before.
Now, when she had knocked, there came to the
door a young maiden, and opened the door and
looked; and, behold, two women were there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maid.</span> Then said the maid to them, "With
whom would you speak in this place?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Christiana answered, "We understand
that this is a place prepared for those that are
become pilgrims, and we now at this door are such;
wherefore we pray that we may be partakers of
that for which we at this time are come; for the
day, as thou seest, is very far spent, and we are
loth to-night to go any farther."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dam.</span> Pray, what may I call your name, that
I may tell it to my lord within?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> My name is Christiana: I was the wife
of that pilgrim that some years ago did travel this
way; and these be his four children. This young
woman is my companion, and is going on pilgrimage
too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Innocent.</span> Then Innocent ran in (for that was
her name,) and said to those within, "Can you
think who is at the door? There are Christiana
and her children, and her companion, all waiting
for entertainment here."</p>

<p>Then they leaped for joy, and went and told
their master. So he came to the door, and looking
upon her, he said, "Art thou that Christiana whom
Christian the good man left behind him, when
he betook himself to a pilgrim's life?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> I am that woman that was so hard-hearted
as to slight my husband's troubles, and
then left him to go on his journey alone; and
these are his four children. But now also I am
come, for I am convinced that no way is right
but this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> Then is fulfilled that which also is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
written of the man that said to his son, "Go,
work to-day in my vineyard;" and he said to his
father, "I will not;" but afterwards he repented,
and went.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Then said Christiana, "So be it: Amen.
God make it a true saying upon me, and grant
that I may be found at the last of Him in peace,
without spot and blameless!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> But why standest thou thus at the
door? Come in, thou blessed one. We were
talking of thee but now; for tidings have come
to us before how thou art become a pilgrim.
Come, children, come in; come, maiden, come in.</p>

<p>So he had them all into the house.</p>


<div class="sidenote">PILGRIMS ENTERTAINED</div>

<p>So when they were within, they were bidden to
sit down and rest them; the which when they
had done, those that attended upon the pilgrims
in the house came into the room to see them.
And one smiled, and another smiled, and they all
smiled for joy that Christiana was become a
pilgrim. They also looked upon the boys; they
stroked them over the faces with the hand, in
token of their kind reception of them; they also
carried it lovingly to Mercy, and bid them all
welcome into their master's house.</p>

<p>After a while, because supper was not ready,
the Interpreter took them into his significant
rooms, and showed them what Christian, Christiana's
husband, had seen some time before.
Here, therefore, they saw the man in the cage, the
man and his dream, the man that cut his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
through his enemies, and the picture of the biggest
of them all, together with the rest of those things
that were then so profitable to Christian.</p>

<p>This done, and after those things had been seen
and thought of by Christiana and her company,
the Interpreter takes them apart again, and has
them first into a room where was a man that
could look no way but downwards, with a muck-rake
in his hand. There stood also one over his
head, with a celestial crown in his hand, and
proffered to give him that crown for his muck-rake;
but the man did neither look up nor regard,
but raked to himself the straws, the small sticks,
and the dust of the floor.</p>

<p>Then said Christiana, "I persuade myself that
I know somewhat the meaning of this; for this is
a figure of a man of this world. Is it not, good
sir?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> "Thou hast said the right," said he;
"and his muck-rake doth show his worldly mind.
And whereas thou seest him rather give heed to
rake up straws and sticks, and the dust of the
floor, than to do what he says that calls to him
from above with the celestial crown in his hand;
it is to show that heaven is but a fable to some,
and that things here are counted the only things
substantial. Now, whereas it was also showed
thee that the man could look no way but downwards;
it is to let thee know that earthly things,
when they are with power upon men's minds,
quite carry their hearts away from God."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Then said Christiana, "Oh, deliver me
from this muck-rake!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> "That prayer," said the Interpreter,
"has lain by till it is almost rusty. 'Give me
not riches' is scarce the prayer of one of ten thousand.
Straws, and sticks, and dust, with most,
are the great things now looked after."</p>

<p>With that, Mercy and Christiana wept, and said,
"It is, alas! too true."</p>

<div class="sidenote">INTERPRETER'S ALLEGORIES</div>

<p>When the Interpreter had showed them this,
he had them into the very best room in the house;
a very brave room it was. So he bid them look
round about, and see if they could find anything
there. Then they looked round and round;
for there was nothing to be seen but a very
great spider on the wall, and that they overlooked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Then said Mercy, "Sir, I see nothing."</p>

<p>But Christiana held her peace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> "But," said the Interpreter, "look
again."</p>

<p>She therefore looked again, and said, "Here is
not anything but an ugly spider, who hangs by
her hands upon the wall."</p>

<p>Then said he, "Is there but one spider in all
this spacious room?"</p>

<p>Then the water stood in Christiana's eyes, for
she was a woman quick of mind; and she said,
"Yes, my lord; there is here more than one; yea,
and spiders whose venom is far more destructive
than that which is in her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>The Interpreter then looked pleasantly upon
her, and said, "Thou hast said the truth."</p>

<p>This made Mercy blush and the boys to cover
their faces; for they all began now to understand
the riddle.</p>

<p>Then said the Interpreter again, "The spider
taketh hold with her hands (as you see), and is in
kings' palaces. And wherefore is this recorded,
but to show you that, how full of the venom of
sin soever you be, yet you may, by the hand of
faith, lay hold of and dwell in the best room that
belongs to the king's house above."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> "I thought," said Christiana, "of something
of this; but I could not imagine it all. I
thought that we were like spiders, and that we
looked like ugly creatures, in what fine rooms soever
we were: but that by this spider, this venomous
and ill-favored creature, we were to learn how
to act faith, that came not into my mind; and
yet she has taken hold with her hands, and, as I
see, dwelleth in the best room in the house. God
has made nothing in vain."</p>

<p>Then they seemed all to be glad, but the water
stood in their eyes; yet they looked one upon another,
and also bowed before the Interpreter.</p>

<p>He had them then into another room, where
were a hen and chickens, and bid them observe
a while. So one of the chickens went to the trough
to drink; and every time she drank, she lifted up
her head and her eyes toward heaven. "See,"
said he, "what this little chick doth; and learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
of her to acknowledge whence your mercies come,
by receiving them with looking up. Yet again,"
said he, "observe and look."</p>

<p>So they gave heed, and perceived that the hen
did walk in a fourfold method towards her
chickens. First, she had a common call, and that
she hath all day long. Secondly, she had a
special call, and that she had but sometimes.
Thirdly, she had a brooding note. And, fourthly
she had an outcry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> "Now," said he, "compare this hen to
your King, and these chickens to His obedient
ones: for, answerable to her, He Himself hath
His methods which He walketh in toward His
people. By His common call, He gives nothing;
by His special call, He always has something to
give; He also has a brooding voice for them that
are under His wing; and He hath an outcry, to
give the alarm when He seeth the enemy come. I
chose, my darlings, to lead you into the room
where such things are, because you are women,
and they are easy for you."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> "And, sir," said Christiana, "pray let
us see some more."</p>

<p>So he had them into the slaughter-house, where
the butcher was killing a sheep; and, behold, the
sheep was quiet, and took her death patiently.
Then said the Interpreter, "You must learn of
this sheep to suffer, and to put up with wrongs
without murmurings and complaints. Behold
how quietly she takes her death; and, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
objecting, she suffereth her skin to be pulled over
her ears. Your King doth call you His sheep."</p>

<p>After this, he led them into his garden, where
was great variety of flowers; and he said, "Do
you see all these?" So Christiana said, "Yes."
Then said he again, "Behold, the flowers are
diverse in stature, in quality, and color, and
smell, and virtue, and some are better than others;
also, where the gardener has set them, there they
stand, and quarrel not one with another."</p>

<p>Again, he had them into his field, which he had
sowed with wheat and corn; but when they beheld,
the tops of all were cut off, and only the
straw remained. He said again, "This ground
was made rich, and was ploughed, and sowed;
but what shall we do with the crop?" Then said
Christiana, "Burn some, and make muck of the
rest." Then said the Interpreter again, "Fruit,
you see, is that thing you look for; and, for want
of that, you send it to the fire, and to be trodden
under foot of men. Beware that in this you
condemn not yourselves."</p>

<p>Then, as they were coming in from abroad, they
espied a little robin with a great spider in his
mouth. So the Interpreter said, "Look here."
So they looked, and Mercy wondered; but Christiana
said, "What a disparagement is it to such a
pretty little bird as the robin-redbreast is; he
being also a bird above many, that loveth to
maintain a kind of sociableness with man! I had
thought they had lived upon crumbs of bread, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
upon other such harmless matter. I like him
worse than I did."</p>

<p>The Interpreter then replied, "This robin is an
emblem very apt, to set forth some people by;
for to sight they are as this robin, pretty of note,
color, and conduct. They seem also to have a
very great love for those that are sincere followers
of Christ; and above all other to desire to associate
with them, and to be in their company,
as if they could live upon the good man's crumbs.
They pretend, also, that therefore it is that they
frequent the house of the godly and the appointments
of the Lord; but, when they are by themselves,
as the robin, they can catch and gobble up
spiders, they can change their diet, drink wickedness,
and swallow down sin like water."</p>

<p>So, when they were come again into the house,
because supper as yet was not ready, Christiana
again desired that the Interpreter would either
show, or tell of, some other things that were
profitable.</p>

<p>Then the Interpreter began, and said, "The
fatter the sow is the more she desires the mire;
the fatter the ox is, the more thoughtlessly he goes
to the slaughter; and the more healthy the lusty
man is, the more prone he is unto evil. There is a
desire in women to go neat and fine; and it is a
comely thing to be adorned with that which in
God's sight is of great price. 'Tis easier watching
a night or two than to sit up a whole year together;
so 'tis easier for one to begin to profess well than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to hold out as he should to the end. Every ship-master,
when in a storm, will willingly cast that
overboard which is of the smallest value in the
vessel; but who will throw the best out first?
None but he that feareth not God. One leak will
sink a ship, and one sin will destroy a sinner.
He that forgets his friends is ungrateful unto him
but he that forgets his Saviour is unmerciful to
himself. He that lives in sin, and looks for happiness
hereafter, is like him that soweth weeds, and
thinks to fill his barn with wheat or barley. If a
man would live well, let him bring before him
his last day, and make it always his company-keeper.
Whispering, and change of thoughts,
prove that sin is in the world. If the world,
which God sets light by, is counted a thing of that
worth with men, what is heaven, that God commendeth!
If the life that is attended with so
many troubles is so loth to be let go by us, what
is the life above! Everybody will cry up the
goodness of men; but who is there that is, as he
should be, affected with the goodness of God?"</p>

<p>When the Interpreter had done, he takes them
out into his garden again, and had them to a tree,
whose inside was all rotten and gone, and yet it
grew and had leaves.</p>

<p>Then said Mercy, "What means this?"</p>

<p>"This tree," said he, "whose outside is fair, and
whose inside is rotten, is that to which many may
be compared that are in the garden of God, who
with their mouths speak high in behalf of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
but indeed will do nothing for Him; whose leaves
are fair, but their heart good for nothing but to
be tinder for the devil's tinder-box."</p>

<p>Now supper was ready, the table spread, and
all things set on the board; so they sat down, and
did eat when one had given thanks. And the
Interpreter did usually entertain those that lodged
with him with music at meals; so the minstrels
played. There was also one that did sing, and a
very fine voice he had. His song was this:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The Lord is only my support,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And He that doth me feed;</span><br />
<span class="i0">How can I then want anything</span><br />
<span class="i1">Whereof I stand in need?"</span>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">DISCOURSE AT SUPPER</div>

<p>When the song and music were ended, the
Interpreter asked Christiana what it was that first
did move her to betake herself to a pilgrim's life.
Christiana answered, "First, the loss of my husband
came into my mind, at which I was heartily
grieved; but all that was but natural affection.
Then, after that, came the troubles and pilgrimages
of my husband into my mind, and also how
unkindly I had behaved to him as to that. So
guilt took hold of my mind, and would have
drawn me into the pond, to drown myself, but
that, just at the right time, I had a dream of the
well-being of my husband, and a letter sent by the
King of that country where my husband dwells,
to come to him. The dream and the letter together
so wrought upon my mind, that they forced
me to this way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> But met you with no opposition afore
you set out of doors?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Yes, a neighbor of mine, one Mrs. Timorous:
she was akin to him that would have persuaded
my husband to go back for fear of the lions.
She all-to-be-fooled me for, as she called it, my intended
desperate adventure; she also urged what
she could to dishearten me from it&mdash;the hardship
and troubles that my husband met with in the
way; but all this I got over pretty well. But a
dream that I had of two ill-looked ones, that I
thought did plot how to make me fail in my journey,
that hath troubled me much: yea, it still runs
in my mind, and makes me afraid of every one
that I meet, lest they should meet me to do me a
mischief, and to turn me out of my way. Yea,
I may tell my Lord, though I would not have
everybody know it, that, between this and the
gate by which we got into the way, we were both
so sorely attacked that we were made to cry out
"murder;" and the two that made this attack upon
us were like the two that I saw in my dream.</p>

<p>Then said the Interpreter, "Thy beginning is
good; thy latter end shall greatly increase." So
he addressed himself to Mercy, and said unto her,
"And what moved thee to come hither, sweetheart?"</p>

<p>Then Mercy blushed and trembled, and for a
while continued silent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> Then said he, "Be not afraid; only
believe, and speak thy mind."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> So she began, and said, "Truly, sir, my
lack of knowledge is that which makes me wish
to be in silence, and that also that fills me with
fears of coming short at last. I cannot tell of
visions and dreams, as my friend Christiana can
nor know I what it is to mourn for my refusing
the advice of those that were good relations."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> What was it, then, dear heart, that hath
prevailed with thee to do as thou hast done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Why, when our friend here was packing
up to be gone from our town, I and another went
accidentally to see her. So we knocked at the
door and went in. When we were within, and
seeing what she was doing, we asked her what was
her meaning. She said she was sent for to go to
her husband; and then she up and told us how
she had seen him in a dream, dwelling in a wonderful
place, among immortals, wearing a crown,
playing upon a harp, eating and drinking at his
Prince's table, and singing praises to Him for
bringing him thither, and so on. Now, methought
while she was telling these things unto us, my
heart burned within me. And I said in my heart,
If this be true, I will leave my father and my
mother, and the land of my birth, and will, if I
may, go along with Christiana. So I asked her
further of the truth of these things, and if she
would let me go with her; for I saw now that
there was no dwelling but with the danger of
ruin any longer in our town. But yet I came
away with a heavy heart; not for that I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
unwilling to come away, but for that so many of my
relations were left behind. And I am come with
all the desire of my heart, and will go, if I may,
with Christiana, unto her husband and his King.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inter.</span> Thy setting out is good, for thou hast
given credit to the truth: thou art a Ruth, who
did, for the love she bare to Naomi and to the
Lord her God, leave father and mother, and the
land of her birth, to come out and go with a people
that she knew not heretofore. The Lord bless
thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the
Lord God of Israel, under whose wings thou art
come to trust.</p>

<p>Now supper was ended, and preparation was
made for bed: the women were laid singly alone,
and the boys by themselves. Now, when Mercy
was in bed, she could not sleep for joy, for that
now her doubts of missing at last were removed
farther from her than ever they were before.
So she lay blessing and praising God, who had had
such favor for her.</p>

<p>In the morning they arose with the sun, and
prepared themselves for their departure; but the
Interpreter would have them tarry a while:
"For," said he, "you must orderly go from hence."
Then said he to the maid that first opened to them,
"Take them and have them into the garden, to the
bath, and there wash them, and make them clean
from the soil which they have gathered by traveling."</p>

<p>Then Innocent the maid took them and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
them into the garden, and brought them to the
bath; so she told them they must wash and be
clean, for so her master would have the women
to do that called at his house as they were going
on pilgrimage. Then they went in and washed,
yea, they and the boys and all; and they came
out of that bath, not only sweet and clean, but
also much enlivened, and strengthened in their
joints. So, when they came in, they looked fairer
a deal than when they went out to the washing.</p>

<p>When they were returned out of the garden
from the bath, the Interpreter took them, and
looked upon them, and said unto them, "Fair as
the moon." Then he called for the seal wherewith
they used to be sealed that were washed in
this bath. So the seal was brought, and he set his
mark upon them, that they might be known in
the places whither they were yet to go; and the
mark was set between their eyes. This seal
added greatly to their beauty, for it was an ornament
to their faces. It also added to their glory, and
made their countenances more like those of angels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CLOTHED IN WHITE RAIMENT</div>

<p>Then said the Interpreter again to the maid
that waited upon these women, "Go into the
vestry, and fetch out garments for these people."
So she went and fetched out white raiment and
laid it down before him; so he commanded them
to put it on; it was fine linen, white and clean.
When the women were thus adorned, they seemed
to be afraid one of the other, for that they could not
see that glory each one had in herself, which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
could see in each other. Now, therefore, they
began to esteem each other better than themselves.
For "You are fairer than I am," said
one; and "You are more beautiful than I am,"
said another. The children also stood amazed,
to see into what fashion they were brought.</p>

<p>The Interpreter then called for a man-servant
of his, one Great-heart, and bid him take sword,
and helmet, and shield, and "Take these my
daughters," said he, "and conduct them to the
house called Beautiful, at which place they will
rest next." So he took his weapons, and went
before them; and the Interpreter said, "God
speed!" Those also that belonged to the family
sent them away with many a good wish. So they
went on their way and sang:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>THE CROSS AND THE CONSEQUENCES.</h3>


<p>Now, I saw in my dream that they went on,
and Great-heart before them. So they
went, and came to the place where Christian's
burden fell off his back and tumbled into a
sepulchre. Here, then, they made a pause, and here
also they blessed God. "Now," said Christiana,
"comes to my mind what was said to us at
the gate, to wit, that we should have pardon
by word and deed: by word, that is, by
the promise; by deed, that is, in the way
it was obtained. What the promise is, of
that I know something; but what it is to have
pardon by deed, or in the way that it was obtained,
Mr. Great-heart, I suppose you know;
wherefore, if you please, let us hear you speak
thereof."</p>

<div class="sidenote">GREAT-HEART DISCOURSES</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Pardon by the deed done, is pardon
obtained by some one for another that hath need
thereof; not by the person pardoned, but in the
way, saith another, in which I have obtained it.
So then, to speak to the question at large, the
pardon that you, and Mercy, and these boys have
obtained, was obtained by another; to wit, by
Him that let you in at the gate. And He hath
obtained it in this double way: He has shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
righteousness to cover you, and spilt His blood
to wash you in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> This is brave! Now I see that there was
something to be learnt by our being pardoned by
word and deed. Good Mercy, let us labor to keep
this in mind; and, my children, do you remember
it also. But, sir, was not this it that made my
good Christian's burden fall from off his shoulders,
and that made him give three leaps for joy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Yes, it was the belief of this that cut
off those strings that could not be cut by other
means; and it was to give him proof of the virtue
of this that he was suffered to carry his burden
to the Cross.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> I thought so; for though my heart was
lightsome and joyous before, yet it is ten times
more lightsome and joyous now. And I am persuaded
by what I have felt, though I have felt
but little as yet, that, if the most burdened man
in the World was here, and did see and believe as
I now do, it would make his heart merry and
blithe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> There is not only comfort and the ease
of a burden brought to us by the sight and consideration
of these, but an endeared love born in
us by it; for who can, if he doth but once think
that pardon comes, not only by promise, but
thus, but be affected with the way and means of
his redemption, and so love the Man that hath
wrought it for him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> True: methinks it makes my heart bleed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
to think that He should bleed for me. Oh, Thou
loving One! Oh, Thou blessed One! Thou
deservest to have me: Thou hast bought me.
Thou deservest to have me all: Thou hast paid
for me ten thousand times more than I am worth.
No marvel that this made the water stand in my
husband's eyes, and that it made him trudge so
nimbly on. I am persuaded he wished me with
him; but, vile wretch that I was! I let him come
all alone. Oh, Mercy, that thy father and mother
were here! yea, and Mrs. Timorous also! Nay,
I wish now with all my heart that here was Madam
Wanton too. Surely, surely, their hearts
would be affected; nor could the fear of the one,
nor the powerful passions of the other, prevail
with them to go home again, and refuse to become
good pilgrims.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great</span>. You speak now in the warmth of your
affections: will it, think you, be always thus with
you? Besides, this is not given to every one, nor
to every one that did see your Jesus bleed. There
were that stood by, and that saw the blood run
from His heart to the ground, and yet were so
far off this, that instead of lamenting, they
laughed at Him, and instead of becoming His
disciples, did harden their hearts against him.
So that all that you have, my daughters, you have
by a peculiar feeling made by a thinking upon
what I have spoken to you. This you have,
therefore, by a special grace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIMPLE, SLOTH, PRESUMPTION</div>

<p>Now, I saw still in my dream, that they went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
on till they were come to the place that Simple,
and Sloth, and Presumption lay and slept in, when
Christian went by on pilgrimage; and, behold,
they were hanged up in irons a little way off on
the other side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Then said Mercy to him that was their
guide and conductor, "What are those three men?
and for what are they hanged there?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> These three men were men of very
bad qualities: they had no mind to be pilgrims
themselves, and whomsoever they could they
hindered. They were for sloth and folly themselves,
and whomsoever they could persuade with,
they made so too, and withal taught them to
presume that they should do well at last. They
were asleep when Christian went by; and, now
you go by, they are hanged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> But could they persuade any to be of
their opinion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Yes, they turned several out of the
way. There was Slow-pace that they persuaded
to do as they. They also prevailed with one
Short-wind, with one No-heart, with one Linger-after-lust,
and with one Sleepy-head, and with
a young woman&mdash;her name was Dull&mdash;to turn
out of the way and become as they. Besides,
they brought up an ill report of your Lord, persuading
others that He was a hard task-master.
They also brought up an evil report of the good
land, saying it was not half so good as some
pretended it was. They also began to speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
falsely about His servants, and to count the very
best of them meddlesome, troublesome busy-bodies.
Further, they would call the bread of
God, husks; the comforts of His children, fancies;
the travel labor of pilgrims, things to no purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> "Nay," said Christiana, "if they were
such, they never shall be bewailed by me: they
have but what they deserve; and I think it is
well that they hang so near the highway, that
others may see and take warning. But had it
not been well if their crimes had been engraven on
some plate of iron or brass, and left here where
they did their mischiefs, for a caution to other
bad men?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> So it is, as you well may perceive, if
you will go a little to the wall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> No, no: let them hang, and their names
rot, and their crimes live for ever against them.
I think it a high favor that they were hanged
afore we came hither who knows, else, what they
might have done to such poor women as we are?</p>

<p>Then she turned it into a song, saying:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Now, then, you three, hang there, and be a sign</span><br />
<span class="i0">To all that shall against the truth combine;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And let him that comes after fear this end,</span><br />
<span class="i0">If unto pilgrims he is not a friend.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And thou, my soul, of all such men beware</span><br />
<span class="i0">That unto holiness opposers are."</span>
</div>

<p>Thus they went on till they came at the foot
of the Hill Difficulty, where again their good
friend Mr. Great-heart took an occasion to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
them of what happened there when Christian
himself went by. So he had them first to the
spring. "Lo," saith he, "this is the spring that
Christian drank of before he went up this hill:
and then it was clear and good; but now it is
dirty with the feet of some that are not desirous
that pilgrims here should quench their thirst."
Thereat Mercy said, "And why are they so
envious, I wonder?" But said their guide, "It
will do if taken up and put into a vessel that is
sweet and good; for then the dirt will sink to the
bottom, and the water come out by itself more
clear." Thus, therefore, Christiana and her
companions were compelled to do. They took
it up, and put it into an earthen pot, and so let it
stand till the dirt was gone to the bottom, and then
they drank thereof.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TWO DANGEROUS PATHS</div>

<p>Next he showed them the two by-ways that
were at the foot of the hill, where Formality and
Hypocrisy lost themselves. And said he, "These
are dangerous paths. Two were here cast away
when Christian came by; and although, as you
see, these ways are since stopped up with chains,
posts, and a ditch, yet there are that will choose
to adventure here, rather than take the pains to
go up this hill."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> The way of transgressors is hard. It is a
wonder that they can get into those ways without
danger of breaking their necks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> They will venture: yea, if at any
time any of the King's servants doth happen to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
see them, and doth call unto them, and tell them
that they are in the wrong ways, and do bid them
beware the danger, then they will railingly return
them answer, and say, "As for the word that thou
hast spoken unto us in the name of the King,
we will not hearken unto thee; but we will certainly
do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our
own mouth." Nay, if you look a little farther,
you shall see that these ways are warned against
enough, not only by these posts, and ditch, and
chain, but also by being hedged up; yet they
will choose to go there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> They are idle: they love not to take
pains: up-hill way is unpleasant to them. So it
is fulfilled unto them as it is written, "The way
of the slothful man is a hedge of thorns." Yea,
they will rather choose to walk upon a snare
than go up this hill, and the rest of this way to
the City.</p>

<p>Then they set forward, and began to go up the
hill; and up the hill they went. But, before they
got to the top, Christiana began to pant, and
said, "I dare say this is a breathing hill: no
marvel if they that love their ease more than their
souls choose to themselves a smoother way."
Then said Mercy, "I must sit down;" also the
least of the children began to cry. "Come,
come," said Great-heart, "sit not down here, for
a little above is the Prince's arbor." Then took
he the little boy by the hand, and led him up
thereto.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ARBOR ON THE HILL</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>When they were come to the arbor, they were
very willing to sit down, for they were all in a
pelting heat. Then said Mercy, "How sweet is
rest to them that labor, and how good is the Prince
of pilgrims to provide such resting-places for
them! Of this arbor I have heard much, but I
never saw it before. But here let us beware of
sleeping; for, as I have heared, for that it cost
poor Christian dear."</p>

<p>Then said Mr. Great-heart to the little ones,
"Come, my pretty boys, how do you do? what
think you now of going on pilgrimage?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said the least, "I was almost beat out
of heart; but I thank you for lending me a hand
at my need. And I remember now what my
mother has told me, namely, 'That the way to
heaven is as up a ladder, and the way to hell is
as down a hill.' But I rather go up the ladder
to life, than the hill to death."</p>

<p>Then said Mercy, "But the proverb, is, 'To
go down the hill is easy.'"</p>

<p>But James said (for that was his name), "The
day is coming when, in my opinion, going down-hill
will be the hardest of all."</p>

<p>"That's a good boy," said his master; "thou
hast given her a right answer."</p>

<p>Then Mercy smiled, but the little boy did blush.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> "Come," said Christiana, "will you eat a
bit, a little to sweeten your mouths, while you
sit here to rest your legs? for I have here a piece
of pomegranate, which Mr. Interpreter put in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
hand just when I came out of his doors: he gave
me also a piece of a honeycomb, and a little bottle
of spirits."</p>

<p>"I thought he gave you something," said
Mercy, "because he called you aside."</p>

<p>"Yes, so he did," said the other; "but, Mercy,
it shall still be as I said it should, when at first
we came from home; thou shalt be a sharer in all
the good that I have, because thou so willingly
didst become my companion."</p>

<p>Then she gave to them, and they did eat, both
Mercy and the boys. And said Christiana to
Mr. Great-heart, "Sir, will you do as we and
take some refreshment?"</p>

<p>But he answered, "You are going on pilgrimage,
and presently I shall return; much good may
have do to you: at home I eat the same every
day."</p>

<p>Now, when they had eaten and drunk, and had
chatted a little longer, their guide said to them,
"The day wears away; if you think good, let us
prepare to be going." So they got up to go, and
the little boys went before; but Christiana forgot
to take her bottle of spirits with her, so she sent
her little boy back to fetch it.</p>

<p>Then said Mercy, "I think this is a losing place:
here Christian lost his roll, and here Christiana
left her bottle behind her. Sir, what is the cause
of this?"</p>

<p>So their guide made answer, and said, "The
cause is sleep or forgetfulness: some sleep when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
they should keep awake, and some forget when
they should remember. And this is the very
cause why often at the resting-places some pilgrims,
in some things, come off losers. Pilgrims
should watch, and remember what they have
already received, under their greatest enjoyments;
but, for want of doing so, ofttimes their rejoicing
ends in tears, and their sunshine in a cloud:
witness the story of Christian at this place."</p>

<div class="sidenote">MISTRUST AND TIMOROUS</div>

<p>When they were come to the place where Mistrust
and Timorous met Christian, to persuade
him to go back for fear of the lions, they perceived
as it were a stage, and before it, towards the road,
a broad plate, with a copy of verses written
thereon, and underneath the reason of the raising
up of that stage in that place rendered. The
verses were these:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Let him that sees this stage take heed</span><br />
<span class="i1">Unto his heart and tongue;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lest, if he do not, here he speed</span><br />
<span class="i1">As some have, long agone."</span>
</div>

<p>The words underneath the verses were, "This
stage was built to punish such upon, who, through
timorousness or mistrust, shall be afraid to go
farther on pilgrimage. Also on this stage both
Mistrust and Timorous were burned through the
tongue with a hot iron, for endeavoring to hinder
Christian in his journey."</p>

<p>Then said Mercy, "This is much like to the
saying of the Beloved, 'What shall be given unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
thee, or what shall be done unto thee, thou false
tongue? Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals
of juniper.'"</p>

<p>So they went on till they came within sight
of the lions. Now, Mr. Great-heart was a strong
man, so he was not afraid of a lion. But yet,
when they were come up to the place where the
lions were, the boys, that went before, were glad
to cringe behind, for they were afraid of the lions
so they stepped back, and went behind.</p>

<p>At this their guide smiled, and said, "How now,
my boys! do you love to go before when no danger
doth approach, and love to come behind so soon
as the lions appear?"</p>

<p>Now, as they went up, Mr. Great-heart drew
his sword, with intent to make a way for the pilgrims
in spite of the lions. Then there appeared
one that, it seems, had taken upon him to back
the lions; and he said to the pilgrims' guide,
"What is the cause of your coming hither?"
Now, the name of that man was Grim, or Bloody-man,
because of his slaying of pilgrims; and he
was of the race of the giants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Then said the pilgrims' guide, "These
women and children are going on pilgrimage, and
this is the way they must go; and go it they shall,
in spite of thee and the lions."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grim.</span> This is not their way, neither shall they
go therein. I am come forth to withstand them,
and to that end will back the lions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GREAT-HEART OVERCOMES GRIM</div>

<p>Now, to say truth, by reason of the fierceness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
of the lions, and of the grim carriage of him that
did back them, this way had of late lain much
unoccupied, and was almost all grown over with
grass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Then said Christiana, "Though the highways
have been unoccupied heretofore, and though
the travellers have been made in times past to
walk through by-paths, it must not be so now I
am risen. 'Now I am risen a mother in Israel.'"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grim</span>. Then he swore by the lions, "But it
should," and therefore bid them turn aside, for
they should not passage there.</p>

<p>But Great-heart their guide made first his
approach unto Grim, and laid so heavily at him
with his sword, that he forced him to a retreat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grim.</span> Then said he that attempted to back
the lions, "Will you slay me upon mine own
ground?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> It is the King's highway that we are
in, and in His way it is that thou hast placed
thy lions; but these women, and these children,
though weak, shall hold on their way in spite
of thy lions.</p>

<p>And, with that, he gave him again a downright
blow, and brought him upon his knees. With this
blow he also broke his helmet, and with the next
he cut off an arm. Then did the giant roar so
hideously, that his voice frighted the women, and
yet they were glad to see him lie sprawling upon
the ground. Now, the lions were chained, and
so of themselves could do nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>Wherefore, when old Grim, that intended to
back them, was dead, Mr. Great-heart said to the
pilgrims, "Come now, and follow me, and no
hurt shall happen to you from the lions." They
therefore went on; but the women trembled as
they passed by them: the boys also looked as
if they would die; but they all got by without
further hurt.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL.</h3>


<p>Now, then, they were within sight of the Porter's
lodge, and they soon came up unto
it; but they made the more haste after
this to go thither, because it is dangerous travelling
there in the night. So, when they were
come to the gate, the guide knocked, and the
Porter cried, "Who is there?" But as soon as
the guide had said "It is I," he knew his voice,
and came down, for the guide had oft before
that come thither as a conductor of pilgrims.
When he was come down he opened the gate;
and, seeing the guide stand just before it (for he
saw not the women, for they were behind him),
he said unto him, "How now, Mr. Great-heart!
what is your business here so late to-night?"</p>

<p>"I have brought," said he, "some pilgrims
hither, where, by my Lord's commandment, they
must lodge. I had been here some time ago,
had I not been opposed by the giant that did use
to back the lions; but I, after a long and tedious
combat with him, have cut him off, and have
brought the pilgrims hither in safety."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Port.</span> Will you not go in, and stay till morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> No, I will return to my Lord to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Oh, sir, I know not how to be willing you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
should leave us in our pilgrimage: you have been
so faithful and so loving to us, you have fought
so stoutly for us, you have been so hearty in
counselling of us, that I shall never forget your
favor towards us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Then said Mercy, "Oh that we might
have thy company to our journey's end! How
can such poor women as we hold out in a way so
full of troubles as this way is, without a friend and
defender?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Then said James, the youngest of the
boys, "Pray, sir, be persuaded to go with us, and
help us, because we are so weak, and the way so
dangerous as it is."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> I am at my Lord's commandment. If
he shall allot me to be your guide quite through,
I will willingly wait upon you. But here you
failed at first; for when he bid me come thus
far with you, then you should have begged me of
him to have gone quite through with you, and he
would have granted your request. However, at
present I must withdraw; and so, good Christiana,
Mercy, and my brave children, adieu.</p>

<p>Then the Porter, Mr. Watchful, asked Christiana
of her country and of her kindred. And she said,
"I come from the City of Destruction. I am a
widow woman, and my husband is dead: his name
was Christian, the pilgrim."</p>

<p>"How!" said the Porter, "was he your husband?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">A JOYFUL RECEPTION</div>

<p>"Yes," said she, "and these are his children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and this" (pointing to Mercy) "is one of my
townswomen."</p>

<p>Then the Porter rang his bell, as at such times
he is wont, and there came to the door one of the
maids, whose name was Humble-mind; and to
her the Porter said, "Go, tell it within that Christiana,
the wife of Christian, and her children,
are come hither on pilgrimage."</p>

<p>She went in, therefore, and told it. But oh,
what a noise for gladness was there within when the
maid did but drop that word out of her mouth!</p>

<p>So they came with haste to the Porter, for
Christiana stood still at the door. Then some
of those within said unto her, "Come in, Christiana,
come in, thou wife of that good man;
come in, thou blessed woman; come in, with all
that are with thee."</p>

<p>So she went in, and they followed her that were
her children and her companions. Now, when
they were gone in, they were had into a very large
room, where they were bidden to sit down. So they
sat down, and the chief of the house were called to
see and welcome the guests. Then they came in
and understanding who they were did salute each
other with a kiss, and said, "Welcome, ye that bear
the grace of God; welcome to us, your friends!"</p>

<p>Now, because it was somewhat late, and because
the pilgrims were weary with their journey, and
also made faint with the sight of the fight, and of
the terrible lions, therefore they desired, as soon
as might be, to prepare to go to rest. "Nay,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
said those of the family, "refresh yourselves first
with a morsel of meat;" for they had prepared
for them a lamb, with the accustomed sauce
belonging thereto, for the Porter had heard before
of their coming, and had told it to them within.
So, when they had supped, and ended their prayer
with a psalm, they desired they might go to rest.</p>

<p>"But let us," said Christiana, "if we may be so
bold as to choose, be in that chamber that was
my husband's when he was here."</p>

<p>So they had them up thither, and they lay all in
a room. When they were at rest, Christiana and
Mercy entered into discourse about things that
were convenient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Little did I think once, when my husband
went on pilgrimage, that I should ever have
followed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> And you as little thought of lying in his
bed, and in his chamber to rest, as you do now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> And much less did I ever think of seeing
his face with comfort, and of worshipping the
Lord the King with him; and yet now I believe I
shall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Hark! don't you hear a noise?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Yes, it is, as I believe, a noise of music,
for joy that we are here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Wonderful! Music in the house, music in
the heart, and music also in heaven, for joy that
we are here!</p>

<div class="sidenote">MERCY'S DREAM</div>

<p>Thus they talked a while, and then betook
themselves to sleep. So in the morning, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
they were awake, Christiana said to Mercy,
"What was the matter, that you did laugh in your
sleep to-night? I suppose you were in a dream."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> So I was, and a sweet dream it was; but
are you sure I laughed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Yes, you laughed heartily; but, prithee,
Mercy, tell me thy dream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> I was dreaming that I sat all alone in a
solitary place, and was bemoaning of the hardness
of my heart. Now, I had not sat there long,
but methought many were gathered about me
to see me, and to hear what it was that I said.
So they hearkened, and I went on bemoaning
the hardness of my heart. At this, some of them
laughed at me, some called me fool, and some
thrust me about. With that, methought I looked
up, and saw one coming with wings towards
me. So he came directly to me, and said, "Mercy,
what aileth thee?" Now, when he had heard
me make my complaint, he said, "Peace be to
thee;" he also wiped mine eyes with his handkerchief,
and clad me in silver and gold. He
put a chain about my neck, and ear-rings in mine
ears, and a beautiful crown upon my head. Then
he took me by the hand, and said, "Mercy, come
after me." So he went up, and I followed, till
we came to a golden gate. Then he knocked;
and when they within opened, the man went
in, and I followed him up to a throne upon which
One sat; and He said to me, "Welcome, daughter!"
The place looked bright and twinkling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
like the stars, or rather like the sun; and I
thought that I saw your husband there. So I
awoke from my dream. But did I laugh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Laugh! ay, and well you might, to see
yourself so well. For you must give me leave
to tell you, that I believe it was a good dream;
and that, as you have begun to find the first part
true, so you shall find the second at last. "God
speaks once, yea, twice, yet man perceiveth it
not; in a dream, in a vision of the night, when
deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings
upon the bed." We need not, when abed, to lie
awake to talk with God: He can visit us while
we sleep, and cause us then to hear His voice.
Our heart oftentimes wakes when we sleep; and
God can speak to that, either by words, by proverbs,
or by signs and similitudes, as well as if
one was awake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Well, I am glad of my dream; for I
hope ere long to see it fulfilled, to the making of
me laugh again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> I think it is now high time to rise, and
to know what we must do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Pray, if they invite us to stay, a while,
let us willingly accept of the proffer. I am the
willinger to stay a while here, to grow better
acquainted with these maids. Methinks Prudence,
Piety, and Charity have very lovely and
sober countenances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> We shall see what they will do.</p>



<p>So, when they were up and ready, they came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
down; and they asked one another of their rest,
and if it was comfortable or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> "Very good," said Mercy; "it was one
of the best nights' lodging that ever I had in
my life."</p>

<p>Then said Prudence and Piety, "If you will
be persuaded to stay here a while, you shall have
what the house will afford."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Char.</span> "Ay, and that with a very good will,"
said Charity.</p>

<p>So they consented, and stayed there about
a month, or above, and became very profitable
one to another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. BRISK VISITS MERCY</div>

<p>Now, by that these pilgrims had been at this
place a week, Mercy had a visitor that pretended
some good-will unto her; and his name was Mr.
Brisk; a man of some breeding, and that pretended
to religion, but a man that stuck very
close to the world. So he came once or twice, or
more, to Mercy, and offered love unto her. Now,
Mercy was a fair countenance, and therefore
the more alluring.</p>

<p>Her mind also was, to be always busying of
herself in doing; for, when she had nothing to
do for herself, she would be making of hose and
garments for others, and would bestow them
upon them that had need. And Mr. Brisk, not
knowing where or how she disposed of what she
made, seemed to be greatly taken, for that he
found her never idle. "I will warrant her a
good housewife," quoth he to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>Mercy then told the matter to the maidens
that were of the house, and inquired of them
concerning him; for they did know him better
than she. So they told her that he was a very
busy young man, and one who pretended to serve
the Lord, but was, as they feared, a stranger to
the power of that which is good.</p>

<p>"Nay, then," said Mercy, "I will look no more
on him; for I purpose never to have a clog to my
soul."</p>

<p>Prudence then replied that "There needed
no great matter of discouragement to be given
to him; her continuing so as she had begun to do
for the poor would quickly cool his courage."</p>

<p>So, the next time he comes, he finds her at her
old work, a-making of things for the poor. Then
said he, "What! always at it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said she, "either for myself or for others."</p>

<p>"And what canst thou earn a day?" quoth he.</p>

<p>"I do these things," said she, "that I may be
rich in good works, laying up in store for myself
a good foundation against the time to come, that
I may lay hold on eternal life."</p>

<p>"Why, prithee, what doest thou with them?"
said he.</p>

<p>"Clothe the naked," said she.</p>

<p>With that, his countenance fell. So he forbore
to come at her again. And when he was asked
the reason why, he said that "Mercy was a pretty
lass, but troubled with too much working for
others."</p>

<div class="sidenote">MERCY REJECTS THE SUITOR</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>When he had left her, Prudence said, "Did I
not tell thee that Mr. Brisk would soon forsake
thee? yea, he will raise up an ill report of thee;
for, notwithstanding his pretence to serve bad and
his seeming love to Mercy, yet Mercy and he are
of tempers so different, that I believe they will
never come together."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> I might have had husbands afore now,
though I spake not of it to any; but they were
such as did not like my ways, though never did
any of them find fault with my person. So
they and I could not agree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prud.</span> Mercy in our days is little set by,
any further than as to its name: the practice,
which is set forth by thy works, there are but
few that can abide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> "Well," said Mercy, "if nobody will have
me, I will die a maid, or my works shall be to me
as a husband; for I cannot change my nature;
and to have one that lies cross to me in this,
that I purpose never to admit of as long as I live.
I had a sister, named Bountiful, that was married
to one of these selfish people; but he and she
could never agree; but, because my sister was
resolved to do as she had begun, that is, to show
kindness to the poor, therefore her husband first
cried her down in public, and then turned her
out of his doors."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prud.</span> And yet he was a church-member, I
warrant you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Yes, such a one as he was; and of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
as he the world is now full; but I am for none of
them at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MATTHEW FALLS SICK</div>

<p>Now Matthew, the eldest son of Christiana,
fell sick, and his sickness was sore upon him for
he was much pained in his bowels; so that he
was with it, at times, pulled as it were both ends
together.</p>

<p>There dwelt also not far from thence one Mr.
Skill, an ancient and well-approved physician.
So Christiana desired it and they sent for him,
and he came. When he was entered the room,
and had a little observed the boy, he concluded
that he was sick of the gripes. Then he said to
his mother, "What diet has Matthew of late fed
upon?"</p>

<p>"Diet!" said Christiana, "nothing but that
which is wholesome."</p>

<p>The physician answered, "This boy has been
tampering with something that lies in his stomach
undigested, and that will not away without means.
And I tell you he must be purged, or else he will
die."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> Then said Samuel, "Mother, what was
that which my brother did gather up and eat,
so soon as we were come from the gate that is at
the head of this way? You know that there
was an orchard on the left hand, on the other
side of the wall, and some of the trees hung over
the wall, and my brother did pull down the
branches and did eat."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> "True, my child," said Christiana, "he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
did take thereof and did eat; naughty boy as
he was, I did chide him, and yet he would eat
thereof."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Skill.</span> I knew he had eaten something that
was not wholesome food; and that food, to wit,
that fruit, is even the most hurtful of all. It is
the fruit of Beelzebub's orchard. I do marvel
that none did warn you of it: many have died
thereof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Then Christiana began to cry, and she
said, "Oh, naughty boy! and oh, careless mother!
What shall I do for my son?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Skill.</span> Come, do not be too much dejected; the
boy may do well again, but he must purge and
vomit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Pray, sir, try the utmost of your skill
with him, whatever it costs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Skill.</span> Nay, I hope I shall be reasonable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DOCTOR SKILL PRESCRIBES</div>

<p>So he made him a purge, but it was too weak;
it was said, it was made of the blood of a goat,
the ashes of an heifer, and with some of the juice
of hyssop, etc. When Mr. Skill had seen that
that purge was too weak, he made him one to the
purpose. It was made [the name was written
in Latin] <i>ex carne et sanguine Christi</i>;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> (you know
physicians give strange medicines to their patients)&mdash;and
it was made up into pills, with a promise
or two, and a proportionable quantity of salt.
Now, he was to take them three at a time, fasting,
in half a quarter of a pint of the tears of sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>When this potion was prepared and brought
to the boy, he was loth to take it, though torn
with the gripes as if he should be pulled in pieces.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said the physician, "you must
take it."</p>

<p>"It goes against my stomach," said the boy.</p>

<p>"I must have you take it," said his mother.</p>

<p>"I shall vomit it up again," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Pray, sir," said Christiana to Mr. Skill, "how
does it taste?"</p>

<p>"It has no ill taste," said the doctor; and with
that she touched one of the pills with the tip of
her tongue.</p>

<p>"O Matthew," said she, "this potion is sweeter
than honey. If thou lovest thy mother, if thou
lovest thy brothers, if thou lovest Mercy, if thou
lovest thy life, take it."</p>

<p>So, with much ado, after a short prayer for the
blessing of God upon it, he took it, and it wrought
kindly with him. It caused him to purge, it
caused him to sleep and rest quietly; it put him
into a fine heat and breathing sweat, and did
quite rid him of his gripes. So, in a little time
he got up, and walked about with a staff, and
would go from room to room, and talk with Prudence,
Piety, and Charity, of his sickness, and
how he was healed.</p>

<p>So, when the boy was healed, Christiana asked
Mr. Skill, saying, "Sir, what will content you for
your pains and care to and of my child?"</p>

<p>And he said, "You must pay the Master of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the College of Physicians, according to the rules
made in that case and provided."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> "But, sir," said she, "what is this pill
good for else?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Skill.</span> It is an universal pill: it is good against
all the diseases that pilgrims are troubled with;
and when it is well prepared, it will keep good
time out of mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Pray, sir, make me up twelve boxes of
them; for if I can get these, I will never take
other physic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Skill.</span> These pills are good to prevent diseases,
as well as to cure when one is sick. Yea, I dare
say it, and stand to it, that if a man will but use
this physic as he should, it will make him live
for ever. But, good Christiana, thou must give
these pills no other way than as I have prescribed;
for if you do, they will do no good. So
he gave unto Christiana physic for herself and
her boys, and for Mercy; and bid Matthew take
heed how he ate any more green plums; and
kissed them and went his way.</p>

<p>It was told you before, that Prudence bid the
boys, if at any time they would, they should ask
her some questions that might be profitable,
and she would say something to them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matt.</span> Then Matthew, who had been sick,
asked her, "Why, for the most part, physic
should be bitter to our palates?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prud.</span> To show how unwelcome the Word of
God, and the effects thereof, are to a sinful heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span><span class="smcap">Matt.</span> Why does physic, if it does good, purge
and cause that we vomit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prud.</span> To show that the Word, when it works
effectually, cleanseth the heart and mind. For
look, what the one doth to the body, the other
doth to the soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matt.</span> What should we learn by seeing the
flame of our fire go upwards, and by seeing the
beams and sweet influences of the sun strike
downwards?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prud.</span> By the going up of the fire, we are
taught to ascend to heaven by fervent and hot
desires. And by the sun's sending his heat,
beams, and sweet influences downwards, we are
taught that the Saviour of the world, though high
reaches down with His grace and love to us
below.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matt.</span> Where have the clouds their water?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prud.</span> Out of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matt.</span> What may we learn from that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prud</span>. That ministers should fetch their teaching
from God.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matt.</span> Why do they empty themselves upon
the earth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prud.</span> To show that ministers should give

<p><span class="smcap">Matt.</span> Why is the rainbow caused by the sun?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prud.</span> To show that the promise of God's grace

to us through the earth?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span><span class="smcap">Prud.</span> To show that the grace of God comes

<p><span class="smcap">Matt.</span> Why do some of the springs rise out of
the tops of high hills?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prud.</span> To show that the spirit of grace shall

<p><span class="smcap">Matt.</span> Why doth the fire fasten upon the

<p><span class="smcap">Matt.</span> Why is the wick, and tallow, and all,
spent to maintain the light of the candle?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>Now, about this time, their month was out;
wherefore they signified to those of the house
that it was convenient for them to be up and
going. Then said Joseph to his mother, "It is
convenient that you forget not to send to the
house of Mr. Interpreter, to pray him to grant
that Mr. Great-heart should be sent unto us,
that he may be our conductor the rest of our way."</p>

<p>"Good boy," said she, "I had almost forgot."
So she drew up a petition, and prayed Mr. Watchful
the Porter to send it by some fit man to her
good friend Mr. Interpreter, who, when it was
come, and he had seen the contents of the petition,
said to the messenger, "Go, tell them that I will
send him."</p>

<p>When the family where Christiana was saw that
they had a purpose to go forward, they called
the whole house together, to give thanks to their
King for sending of them such profitable guests
as these. Which done, they said unto Christiana,
"And shall we not show thee something, according,
as our custom is to do to pilgrims, on which thou
mayest meditate when thou art upon the way?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PILGRIMS VIEW CURIOSITIES</div>

<p>So they took Christiana, her children, and
Mercy, into the closet, and showed them one of
the apples that Eve did eat of, and that which
she also did give to her husband, and that for the
eating of which they were both turned out of Paradise,
and asked her what she thought that was.</p>

<p>Then Christiana said, "It is food or poison,
I know not which."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>So they opened the matter to her, and she held
up her hands and wondered.</p>

<p>Then they had her to a place, and showed her
Jacob's ladder. Now, at that time there were
some angels ascending upon it. So Christiana
looked and looked, to see the angels go up, and
so did the rest of the company. Then they were
going into another place, to show them something
else; but James said to his mother, "Pray bid
them stay here a little longer, for this is a curious
sight." So they turned again, and stood feeding
their eyes with this so pleasing a prospect.</p>

<p>After this they had them into a place where did
hang up a golden anchor. So they bid Christiana
take it down; "For," said they, "you shall have
it with you, for it is of absolute necessity that you
should, that you may lay hold of that within the veil,
and stand steadfast, in case you should meet with
turbulent weather." So they were glad thereof.</p>

<p>Then they took them, and had them to the
mount upon which Abraham our father had offered
up Isaac his son, and showed them the altar, the
wood, the fire, and the knife; for they remain to
be seen to this very day. When they had seen it,
they held up their hands, and blessed themselves,
and said, "Oh! what a man for love to his Master,
and for denial to himself, was Abraham!"</p>

<p>After they had showed them all these things,
Prudence took them into the dining-room, where
stood a pair of excellent virginals;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> so she played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
upon them, and turned what she had showed
them into this excellent song, saying:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Eve's apple we have showd you&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i1">Of that be you aware;</span><br />
<span class="i0">You have seen Jacob's ladder too,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Upon which angels are.</span><br />
<span class="i0">An anchor you receivd have:</span><br />
<span class="i1">But let not these suffice,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Until with Abra'm, you have gave</span><br />
<span class="i1">Your best a sacrifice."</span>
</div>


<div class="sidenote">GREAT-HEART CONDUCTS THEM</div>

<p>Now, about this time, one knocked at the door.
So the Porter opened, and behold, Mr. Great-heart
was there; but when he was come in, what
joy was there! For it came now fresh again into
their minds, how, but a while ago, he had slain old
Grim Bloody-man, the giant, and had delivered
them from the lions.</p>

<p>Then said Mr. Great-heart to Christiana and to
Mercy, "My lord has sent each of you a bottle of
wine, and also some parched corn, together with a
couple of pomegranates; he has also sent the boys
some figs and raisins, to refresh you in your way."</p>

<p>Then they addressed themselves to their journey;
and Prudence and Piety went along with
them. When they came at the gate, Christiana
asked the Porter if any one of late went by.</p>

<p>He said, "No; only one some time since, who
also told me that, of late, there had been a great
robbery committed on the King's highway as you
go. But he saith the thieves are taken, and will
shortly be tried for their lives."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>Then Christiana and Mercy were afraid; but
Matthew said, "Mother, fear nothing as long as
Mr. Great-heart is to go with us, and to be our
conductor."</p>

<p>Then said Christiana to the Porter, "Sir, I am
much obliged to you for all the kindnesses that
you have shown me since I came hither, and also
for that you have been so loving and kind to my
children. I know not how to gratify your kindness;
wherefore, pray, as a token of my respects
to you, accept of this small mite."</p>

<p>So she put a gold angel<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> in his hand; and he
made her a low obeisance, and said, "Let thy garments
be always white, and let thy head want no
ointment. Let Mercy live and not die, and let
not her works be few." And to the boys he said,
"Do you flee youthful passions, and follow after
godliness with them that are grave and wise,
so shall you put gladness into your mother's
heart, and obtain praise of all that are sober-minded."</p>

<p>So they thanked the Porter, and departed.</p>

<p>Now I saw in my dream that they went forward
until they were come to the brow of the hill;
where Piety, bethinking herself, cried out, "Alas!
I have forgot what I intended to bestow upon
Christiana and her companions: I will go back
and fetch it." So she ran and fetched it. While
she was gone, Christiana thought she heard, in a
grove a little way off on the right hand, a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
curious melodious note, with words much like
these:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Through all my life Thy favor is</span><br />
<span class="i1">So frankly showed to me,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That in Thy house for evermore</span><br />
<span class="i1">My dwelling-place shall be."</span>
</div>

<p>And listening still, she thought she heard
another answer it, saying:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"For why? the Lord our God is good;</span><br />
<span class="i1">His mercy is for ever sure;</span><br />
<span class="i0">His truth at all times firmly stood,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And shall from age to age endure."</span>
</div>

<p>So Christiana asked Prudence what it was that
made those curious notes. "They are," said she,
"our country birds: they sing these notes but
seldom, except it be at the spring, when the
flowers appear and the sun shines warm, and then
you may hear them all day long. I often," said
she, "go out to hear them; we also ofttimes keep
them tame in our house. They are very fine
company for us when we are melancholy; also
they make the woods, and groves, and solitary
places, places desirable to be in."</p>

<p>By this time Piety was come again. So she
said to Christiana, "Look here: I have brought
thee a plan of all those things that thou hast seen
at our house, upon which thou mayest look when
thou findest thyself forgetful, and call those
things again to remembrance for thy teaching
and comfort."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THE VALLEY OF HUMILIATION.</h3>

<p>Now they began to go down the hill into
the Valley of Humiliation. It was a
steep hill, and the way was slippery; but
they were very careful, so they got down pretty
well. When they were down in the valley, Piety
said to Christiana, "This is the place where
Christian, your husband, met with the foul fiend
Apollyon, and where they had that dreadful fight
that they had: I know you cannot but have
heard thereof. But be of good courage: as long
as you have here Mr. Great-heart to be your guide
and conductor, we hope you will fare the
better."</p>

<p>So when these two had given the pilgrims unto
the care of their guide, he went forward, and they
went after.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Then said Mr. Great-heart, "We need
not to be so afraid of this valley, for here is nothing
to hurt us, unless we procure it to ourselves. It is
true that Christian did here meet with Apollyon,
with whom he had also a sore combat; but that
fray was the fruit of those slips that he got in his
going down the hill; for they that get slips there,
must look for combats here. And hence it is that
this valley has got so hard a name. For the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
people, when they hear that some frightful
thing has befallen such a one in such a place, are
of an opinion that that place is haunted with some
foul fiend or evil spirit; when, alas! it is for the
fruit of their doing that such things do befall
them there. This Valley of Humiliation is of
itself as fruitful a place as any the crow flies over;
and I am persuaded, if we could hit upon it, we
might find, somewhere hereabouts, something that
might give us an account why Christian was so
hardly beset in this place."</p>

<p>Then James said to his mother, "Lo, yonder
stands a pillar, and it looks as if something was
written thereon: let us go and see what it is."
So they went, and found there written, "Let
Christian's slips before he came hither, and the
battles that he met with in this place, be a warning
to those that come after."</p>

<p>"Lo!" said their guide, "did not I tell you that
there was something hereabouts that would give
intimation of the reason why Christian was so
hard beset in this place?" Then turning himself
to Christiana, he said, "No disgrace to Christian,
more than to many others whose hap and loss his
was; for it is easier going up than down this hill;
and that can be said but of few hills in all these
parts of the world. But we will leave the good
man: he is at rest; he also had a brave victory
over his enemy. Let Him that dwelleth above
grant that we fare no worse, when we come to be
tried, than he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>"But we will come again to this Valley of
Humiliation. It is the best and most fruitful
piece of ground in all these parts. It is fat
ground, and, as you see, consisteth much in
meadows; and if a man was to come here in the
summer-time, as we do now, if he knew not anything
before thereof, and if he also delighted himself
in the sight of his eyes, he might see that that
would be delightful to him. Behold how green
this valley is, also how beautified with lilies!
I have also known many laboring men that have
got good estates in this valley of Humiliation; for
'God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to
the humble.' Indeed, it is a very fruitful soil,
and doth bring forth by handfuls. Some
also have wished that the next way to their
Father's house were here, that they might be
troubled no more with either hills or mountains
to go over; but the way is the way, and there's
an end."</p>

<p>Now, as they were going along and talking, they
espied a boy feeding his father's sheep. The boy
was in very mean clothes, but of a very fresh and
well-favored countenance; and as he sat by himself
he sang. "Hark," said Mr. Great-heart, "to
what the shepherd's boy saith." So they
hearkened, and he said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He that is down needs fear no fall</span><br />
<span class="i1">He that is low, no pride;</span><br />
<span class="i0">He that is humble ever shall</span><br />
<span class="i1">Have God to be his guide.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span><span class="i0">"I am content with what I have</span><br />
<span class="i1">Little be it or much:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, Lord, contentment still I crave</span><br />
<span class="i1">Because Thou savest much.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fulness to such a burden is,</span><br />
<span class="i1">That go on pilgrimage;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Here little, and hereafter bliss,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Is best from age to age."</span>
</div></div>

<p>Then said their guide, "Do you hear him? I
will dare to say that this boy lives a merrier life,
and wears more of that herb called heart's-ease
in his bosom, than he that is clad in silk and
velvet. But we will proceed in our account of
this valley.</p>

<p>"In this valley our Lord formerly had His
country house: He loved much to be here. He
loved also to walk these meadows, for He found
the air was pleasant. Besides, here a man shall
be free from the noise and from the hurryings of
this life. All states are full of noise and confusion,
only the Valley of Humiliation is that empty and
solitary place. Here a man shall not be so let
and hindered in his thoughts as in other places he
is apt to be. This is a valley that nobody walks
in but those that love a pilgrim's life. And though
Christian had the hard hap to meet here with
Apollyon, and to enter with him into a brisk
encounter, yet I must tell you that in former times
men have met with angels here, have found pearls
here, and have in this place found the words of life.</p>

<p>"Did I say, our Lord had here in former days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
His country house, and that He loved here to
walk? I will add, in this place, and to the people
that love to tread these grounds, He has left a
yearly sum of money, to be faithfully paid them
at certain seasons, for their support by the way,
and for their further encouragement to go on
their pilgrimage."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> Now, as they went on, Samuel said to
Mr. Great-heart, "Sir, I perceive that in this
valley my father and Apollyon had their battle;
but whereabout was the fight? for I perceive this
valley is large."</p>

<div class="sidenote">FORGETFUL GREEN</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Your father had that battle with
Apollyon at a place yonder before us, in a narrow
passage just beyond Forgetful Green. And, indeed,
that place is the most dangerous place in all
these parts. For, if at any time the pilgrims meet
with any brunt, it is when they forget what favors
they have received, and how unworthy they are
of them. This is the place also where others have
been hard put to it. But more of the place when
we are come to it; for I persuade myself, that to
this day there remains either some sign of the
battle, or some monument to testify that such a
battle there was fought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Then said Mercy, "I think that I am as
well in this valley as I have been anywhere else
in all our journey: the place, methinks, suits with
my spirit. I love to be in such places, where there
is no rattling with coaches nor rumbling with
wheels. Methinks here one may, without much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
trouble, be thinking what he is, whence he came,
what he has done, and to what the King has called
him. Here one may think and break at heart,
and melt in one's spirit, until one's eyes become
like the fish-pools in Heshbon. They that go
rightly through this Valley of Baca, make it a
well; the rain that God sends down from heaven
upon them that are here also filleth the pools.
This valley is that from whence also the King will
give to His their vineyards; and they that go
through it shall sing, as Christian did, for all he
met with Apollyon."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> "'Tis true," said their guide; "I have
gone through this valley many a time, and never
was better than when here. I have also been a
conductor to several pilgrims, and they have confessed
the same. 'To this man will I look,' saith
the King, 'even to him that is poor and of a contrite
spirit, and that trembleth at my word.'"</p>

<p>Now they were come to the place where the
afore-mentioned battle was fought. Then said
the guide to Christiana, her children, and Mercy,
"This is the place; on this ground Christian stood,
and up there came Apollyon against him. And
look&mdash;did not I tell you?&mdash;here is some of your
husband's blood upon these stones to this day.
Behold, also, how here and there are yet to be seen
upon the place some of the shivers of Apollyon's
broken darts. See also how they did beat the
ground with their feet as they fought, to make
good their places against each other; how also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
with their by-blows, they did split the very stones
in pieces. Verily, Christian did here play the
man, and showed himself as stout as could, had he
been there, even Hercules himself. When Apollyon
was beat, he made his retreat to the next
valley, that is called the Valley of the Shadow of
Death, unto which we shall come soon. Lo,
yonder also stands a monument, on which is
engraven this battle, and Christian's victory, to
his fame throughout all ages."</p>

<div class="sidenote">VALLEY OF SHADOW OF DEATH</div>

<p>So, because it stood just on the way-side before
them, they stepped to it, and read the writing,
which word for word was this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hard by here was a battle fought,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Most strange, and yet most true;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Christian and Apollyon sought</span><br />
<span class="i1">Each other to subdue.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The man so bravely played the man,</span><br />
<span class="i1">He made the fiend to fly;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of which a monument I stand,</span><br />
<span class="i1">The same to testify."</span>
</div></div>

<p>When they had passed by this place, they came
upon the borders of the Shadow of Death. This
valley was longer than the other; a place also
most strangely haunted with evil things, as many
are able to testify; but these women and children
went the better through it, because they had daylight,
and because Mr. Great-heart was their
conductor.</p>

<p>When they were entered upon this valley, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
thought that they heard a groaning, as of dead
men&mdash;a very great groaning. They thought also
that they did hear words of moaning spoken, as
of some in extreme torment. These things made
the boys to quake; the women also looked pale
and wan; but their guide bid them be of good
comfort.</p>

<p>So they went on a little farther, and they
thought that they felt the ground begin to shake
under them, as if some hollow place was there;
they heard also a kind of hissing, as of serpents;
but nothing as yet appeared. Then said the boys,
"Are we not yet at the end of this doleful place?"
But the guide also bid them be of good courage,
and look well to their feet; "lest haply," said he,
"you be taken in some snare."</p>

<p>Now James began to be sick; but I think the
cause thereof was fear; so his mother gave him
some of that glass of spirits that had been given
her at the Interpreter's house, and three of the
pills that Mr. Skill had prepared; and the boy
began to revive. Thus they went on till they
came to about the middle of the valley; and then
Christiana said, "Methinks I see something yonder
upon the road before us, a thing of such a shape as
I have not seen." Then said Joseph, "Mother,
what is it?" "An ugly thing, child, an ugly
thing," said she. "But, mother, what is it like?"
said he. "'Tis like I cannot tell what," said she,
"and now it is but a little way off." Then said
she, "It is nigh!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESIST THE DEVIL</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>"Well, well," said Mr. Great-heart, "let them
that are most afraid keep close to me." So the
fiend came on, and the conductor met it; but,
when it was just come to him, it vanished to all
their sights. Then remembered they what had
been said some time ago, "Resist the devil, and
he will flee from you."</p>

<p>They went therefore on, as being a little refreshed.
But they had not gone far before Mercy,
looking behind her, saw, as she thought, something
most like a lion, and it came a great padding
pace after; and it had a hollow voice of roaring,
and at every roar that it gave it made all the
valley echo, and all their hearts to ache, save the
heart of him that was their guide. So it came up,
and Mr. Great-heart went behind, and put the
pilgrims all before him. The lion also came on
apace, and Mr. Great-heart addressed himself to
give him battle. But, when he saw that it was
determined that resistance should be made, he
also drew back, and came no farther.</p>

<p>They then went on again, and their conductor
did go before them, till they came to a place where
was cast up a pit the whole breadth of the way;
and before they could be prepared to go over that,
a great mist and darkness fell upon them, so that
they could not see. Then said the pilgrims,
"Alas! what now shall we do?" But their guide
made answer, "Fear not, stand still, and see what
an end will be put to this also." So they stayed
there, because their path was marred. They then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
also thought that they did hear more apparently
the noise and rushing of the enemies; the fire also,
and the smoke of the pit, were much easier to be
discerned. Then said Christiana to Mercy, "Now
I see what my poor husband went through. I
have heard much of this place, but I never was
here before now. Poor man! he went here all
alone in the night; he had night almost quite
through the way; also these fiends were busy
about him, as if they would have torn him in
pieces. Many have spoken of it, but none can
tell what the Valley of the Shadow of Death
should mean, until they come in it themselves.
'The heart knoweth its own bitterness, and a
stranger intermeddleth not with its joy.' To be
here is a fearful thing."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> This is like doing business in great
waters, or like going down into the deep. This is
like being in the heart of the sea, and like going
down to the bottoms of the mountains. Now it
seems as if the earth, with its bars, were about us
for ever. But let them that walk in darkness and
have no light, trust in the name of the Lord, and
stay upon their God. For my part, as I have told
you already, I have gone often through this
valley, and have been much harder put to
it than now I am; and yet, you see, I am
alive. I would not boast, for that I am
not mine own saviour; but I trust we shall
have a good deliverance. Come, let us pray
for light to Him that can lighten our darkness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
and that can rebuke not only these, but all the
Satans in hell.</p>

<p>So they cried and prayed, and God sent light
and deliverance; for there was now no hindrance
in their way, no, not there where but now they
were stopped with a pit. Yet they were not got
through the valley; so they went on still; and
behold, great stinks and loathsome smells, to the
great annoyance of them. Then said Mercy to
Christiana, "It is not so pleasant being here as at
the gate, or at the Interpreter's, or at the house
where we lay last."</p>

<p>"Oh, but," said one of the boys, "it is not so
bad to go through here as it is to abide here
always; and, for aught I know, one reason why
we must go this way to the house prepared for us
is, that our home might be made the sweeter to
us."</p>

<p>"Well said, Samuel," quoth the guide; "thou
hast now spoke like a man."</p>

<p>"Why, if ever I get out here again," said the
boy, "I think I shall prize light and good way
better than ever I did in all my life."</p>

<p>Then said the guide, "We shall be out by-and-by."</p>

<p>So on they went, and Joseph said, "Cannot we
see to the end of this valley as yet?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">AMONG THE SNARES</div>

<p>Then said the guide, "Look to your feet, for we
shall presently be among the snares."</p>

<p>So they looked to their feet, and went on; but
they were troubled much with the snares. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
when they were come among the snares, they
espied a man cast into the ditch on the left hand,
with his flesh all rent and torn.</p>

<p>Then said the guide, "That is one Heedless,
that was going this way; he has lain there a great
while. There was one Take-heed with him when
he was taken and slain, but he escaped their hands.
You cannot imagine how many are killed hereabouts;
and yet men are so foolishly venturous
as to set out lightly on pilgrimage, and to come
without a guide. Poor Christian! it is a wonder
that he here escaped; but he was beloved of his
God, also he had a good heart of his own, or else
he could never have done it."</p>

<div class="sidenote">GREAT-HEART ENCOUNTERS MAUL</div>

<p>Now they drew towards the end of the way;
and just where Christian had seen the cave when
he went by, out thence came forth Maul, a giant.
This Maul did use to spoil young pilgrims by deceiving
them; and he called Great-heart by his
name, and said unto him, "How many times have
you been forbidden to do these things?"</p>

<p>Then said Mr. Great-heart, "What things?"</p>

<p>"What things!" quoth the giant; "you know
what things; but I will put an end to your trade."</p>

<p>"But pray," said Mr. Great-heart, "before we
fall to it, let us understand wherefore we must
fight."</p>

<p>Now the women and children stood trembling,
and knew not what to do.</p>

<p>Quoth the giant, "You rob the country, and
rob it with the worst of thefts."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>"These are but random words," said Mr. Great-heart;
"tell what robberies I have done, man."</p>

<p>Then said the giant, "Thou practicest the craft
of a kidnapper: thou gatherest up women and
children, and carriest them into a strange country,
to the weakening of my master's kingdom."</p>

<p>But now Great-heart replied, "I am a servant
of the God of heaven; my business is to persuade
sinners to turn to God. I am commanded to do
my best to turn men, women, and children from
darkness to light, and from the power of Satan
unto God; and if this be indeed the ground of thy
quarrel, let us fall to it as soon as thou wilt."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GIANT IS SLAIN</div>

<p>Then the giant came up, and Mr. Great-heart
went to meet him; and as he went, he drew his
sword, but the giant had a club. So without
more ado they fell to it; and, at the first blow, the
giant struck Mr. Great-heart down upon one of
his knees. With that, the women and children
cried out. So Mr. Great-heart, recovering himself,
laid about him in full lusty manner, and gave the
giant a wound in his arm. Thus he fought for
the space of an hour, to that height of heat, that
the breath came out of the giant's nostrils as the
heat doth out of a boiling cauldron.</p>

<p>Then they sat down to rest them; but Mr.
Great-heart betook himself to prayer. Also the
women and children did nothing but sigh and cry
all the time that the battle did last.</p>

<p>When they had rested them, and taken breath,
they both fell to it again; and Mr. Great-heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
with a blow fetched the giant down to the ground.
"Nay, hold, and let me recover," quoth he. So
Mr. Great-heart fairly let him get up: so to it they
went again; and the giant missed but little of
breaking Mr. Great-heart's skull with his club.</p>

<p>Mr. Great-heart seeing that, runs to him in the
full heat of his spirit, and pierceth him under the
fifth rib. With that the giant began to faint,
and could hold up his club no longer. Then Mr.
Great-heart seconded his blow, and smote the
head of the giant from his shoulders. Then the
women and the children rejoiced, and Mr. Great-heart
also praised God for the deliverance He had
wrought.</p>

<p>When this was done, they amongst them erected
a pillar, and fastened the giant's head thereon,
and wrote under it in letters that passengers
might read:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"He that did wear this head, was one</span><br />
<span class="i1">That pilgrims did misuse;</span><br />
<span class="i0">He stopped their way, he spared none,</span><br />
<span class="i1">But did them all abuse;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Until that I, Great-heart, arose,</span><br />
<span class="i1">The pilgrims' guide to be;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Until that I did him oppose</span><br />
<span class="i1">That was their enemy."</span>
</div>



<p>Now, I saw that they went to the high ground
that was a little way off, cast up to be a prospect
for pilgrims. That was the place from whence
Christiana had the first sight of Faithful his
brother. Wherefore here they sat down and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
rested. They also here did eat and drink and make
merry, for that they had gotten deliverance from
this so dangerous an enemy. As they sat thus
and did eat, Christiana asked the guide if he had
caught no hurt in the battle. Then said Mr.
Great-heart, "No, save a little on my flesh; yet that
also shall be so far from being to my harm that it
is at present a proof of my love to my Master and
you, and shall be a means, by grace, to increase
my reward at last."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> But were you not afraid, good sir, when
you saw him come out with his club?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> "It is my duty," said he, "to mistrust
my own ability, that I may have trust in Him who
is stronger than all."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> But what did you think when he fetched
you down to the ground at the first blow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> "Why, I thought," replied he, "that so
my Master Himself was served; and yet He it was
that conquered at the last."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matt.</span> When you all have thought what you
please, I think God has been wonderful good unto
us, both in bringing us out of this valley, and in
delivering us out of the hand of this enemy. For
my part, I see no reason why we should distrust
our God any more, since He has now, and in such
a place as this, given us such proof of His love as
this.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OLD HONEST</div>

<p>Then they got up and went forward. Now, a
little before them stood an oak; and under it, when
they came to it, they found an old pilgrim fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
asleep. They knew that he was a pilgrim by his
clothes, and his staff, and his girdle.</p>

<p>So the guide, Mr. Great-heart, awaked him;
and the old gentleman, as he lifted up his eyes,
cried out, "What's the matter? what are you, and
what is your business here?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Come, man, be not so hot; here are
none but friends.</p>

<p>Yet the old man gets up, and stands upon his
guard, and will know of them what they are.
Then said the guide, "My name is Great-heart;
I am the guide of these pilgrims, that are going to
the Celestial Country."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honest.</span> Then said Mr. Honest, "I cry you
mercy: I feared that you had been of the company
of those that some time ago did rob
Little-Faith of his money; but now I look
better about me I perceive you are honester
people."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Why, what would or could you have
done to have helped yourself, if we indeed had
been of that company?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Done! why, I would have fought as long
as breath had been in me; and, had I so done, I
am sure you could never have given me the worst
on't, for a Christian can never be overcome unless
he shall yield of himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> "Well said, Father Honest," quoth the
guide; "for by this I know thou art a cock of the
right kind, for thou hast said the truth."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> And by this also I know that thou knowest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
what true pilgrimage is; for all others do think
that we are the soonest overcome of any.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONVERSES WITH HONEST</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Well, now we are so happily met, pray
let me crave your name, and the name of the place
you came from.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> My name I cannot; but I came from the
town of Stupidity; it lieth about four degrees
beyond the City of Destruction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Oh! are you that countryman? then
I deem I have half a guess of you: your name
is old Honesty, is it not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> So the old gentleman blushed, and said,
"Not Honesty, but Honest is my name; and I
wish that my nature may agree to what I am called.
But, sir," said the old gentleman, "how could
you guess that I am such a man, since I came
from such a place?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> I had heard of you before by my Master;
for He knows all things that are done on the
earth. But I have often wondered that any
should come from your place, for your town is
worse than is the City of Destruction itself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Yes, we lie more off from the sun, and so
are more cold and senseless. But were a man in a
mountain of ice, yet if the Sun of Righteousness
should rise upon him, his frozen heart shall feel a
thaw; and thus it hath been with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> I believe it, Father Honest, I believe
it; for I know the thing is true.</p>

<p>Then the old gentleman saluted all the pilgrims
with a holy kiss of love, and asked them their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
names, and how they had fared since they had set
out on their pilgrimage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Then said Christiana, "My name I suppose
you have heard of: good Christian was my
husband, and these are his children."</p>

<p>But can you think how the old gentleman was
taken when she told him who she was? He
skipped, he smiled, he blessed them with a thousand
good wishes, saying:</p>



<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> I have heard much of your husband, and
of his travels and wars which he underwent in his
days. Be it spoken to your comfort, the name of
your husband rings all over these parts of the
world: his faith, his courage, his enduring, and his
sincerity under all, have made his name famous.
Then he turned him to the boys, and asked of
them their names, which they told him. Then he
said unto them, "Matthew, be thou like Matthew
the publican, not in vice, but in virtue. Samuel,"
said he, "be thou like Samuel the prophet, a man
of faith and prayer. Joseph," said he, "be thou
like Joseph in Potiphar's house, pure, and one that
flees from temptation. And James, be thou like
James the Just, and like James the brother of our
Lord." Then they told him of Mercy, and how
she had left her town and her kindred to come
along with Christiana and with her sons. At
that, the old honest man said, "Mercy is thy
name? by Mercy shalt thou be sustained and
carried through all those difficulties that shall
attack thee in thy way, till thou shalt come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
thither where thou shalt look the Fountain of
Mercy in the face with comfort."</p>

<p>All this while the guide, Mr. Great-heart, was
very well pleased and smiled upon his companion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEY DISCUSS MR. FEARING</div>

<p>Now, as they walked along together, the guide
asked the old gentleman if he did not know one
Mr. Fearing, that came on pilgrimage out of his
parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> "Yes, very well," said he. "He was a
man that had the root of the matter in him; but
he was one of the most troublesome pilgrims that
ever I met with in all my days."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> I perceive you knew him, for you have
given a very right character of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Knew him! I was a great companion of
his; I was with him most an end: when he first
began to think upon what would come upon us
hereafter, I was with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> I was his guide from my master's
house to the gates of the Celestial City.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Then you knew him to be a troublesome
one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> I did so; but I could very well bear it,
for men of my calling are oftentimes entrusted
with the conduct of such as he was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Well, then, pray let us hear a little of
him, and how he managed himself under your
conduct.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Why, he was always afraid that he
should come short of whither he had a desire to go.
Everything frightened him that he heard anybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
speak of, if it had but the least appearance of
opposition in it. I hear that he lay roaring at the
Slough of Despond for above a month together;
nor durst he, for all he saw several go over before
him, venture, though they, many of them, offered
to lend him their hand. He would not go back
again neither. The Celestial City, he said, he
should die if he came not to it; and yet was discouraged
at every difficulty, and stumbled at every
straw that anybody cast in his way. Well, after
he had lain at the Slough of Despond a great
while, as I have told you, one sunshine morning,
I don't know how, he ventured, and so got over;
but, when he was over, he would scarce believe it.
He had, I think, a Slough of Despond in his mind,
a slough that he carried everywhere with him, or
else he could never have been as he was. So he
came up to the gate (you know what I mean) that
stands at the head of this way, and here also he
stood a good while before he would venture to
knock. When the gate was opened, he would give
back, and give place to others, and say that he was
not worthy. For, for all he got before some to the
gate, yet many of them went in before him.
There the poor man would stand shaking and
shrinking: I dare say it would have pitied one's
heart to have seen him. Nor would he go back
again. At last, he took the hammer that hanged
on the gate in his hand, and gave a small rap or
two; then One opened to him, but he shrank back
as before. He that opened stepped out after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
him, and said, "Thou trembling one, what wantest
thou?" With that, he fell down to the ground.
He that spoke to him wondered to see him so
faint; so He said to him, "Peace be to thee: up,
for I have set open the door to thee; come in,
for thou are blessed." With that, he got up, and
went in trembling; and when he was in, he was
ashamed to show his face. Well, after he had
been entertained there a while, as you know how
the manner is, he was bid go on his way, and also
told the way he should take. So he came till he
came to our house; but as he behaved himself
at the gate, so he did at my master the Interpreter's
door. He lay thereabout in the cold a
good while before he would venture to call: yet
he would not go back; and the nights were long
and cold then. Nay, he had a note of need in his
bosom to my master, to receive him and grant
him the comfort of his house, and also to allow
him a stout and valiant conductor, because he
was himself so chicken-hearted a man; and yet,
for all that, he was afraid to call at the door.
So he lay up and down thereabouts, till, poor man,
he was almost starved; yea, so great was his
fear, though he had seen several others for knocking
get in, yet he was afraid to venture. At last,
I think I looked out of the window, and perceiving
a man to be up and down about the door, I
went out to him, and asked what he was; but,
poor man, the water stood in his eyes; so I perceived
what he wanted. I went therefore in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
and told it in the house, and we showed the things
to our Lord: so he sent me out again, to entreat
him to come in; but I dare say I had hard work
to do it. At last he came in; and I will say that
for my Lord, he carried it wonderful lovingly to
him. There were but few good bits at the table,
but some of it was laid upon his trencher. Then
he presented the note; and my Lord looked thereon,
and said his desire should be granted. So,
when he had been there a good while, he seemed to
get some heart, and to be a little more comfortable.
For my master, you must know, is one of very
tender heart, specially to them that are afraid;
wherefore he carried it so towards him as might
tend most to his encouragement. Well, when he
had a sight of the things of the place, and was
ready to take his journey to go to the City, my
Lord, as he did to Christian before, gave him a
bottle of spirits, and some comfortable things to
eat. Thus we set forward, and I went before him;
but the man was but of few words, only he would
sigh aloud.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GREAT-HEART'S REMINISCENCES</div>

<p>When we were come to the place where the three
fellows were hanged, he said that he doubted that
that would be his end also. Only he seemed glad
when he saw the Cross and the sepulchre. There,
I confess, he desired to stay a little to look; and he
seemed, for a little while after, to be a little cheery.
When we came at the Hill Difficulty, he made no
stick at that, nor did he much fear the lions, for
you must know that his trouble was not about such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
things as those; his fear was about his acceptance
at last.</p>

<p>I got him in at the House Beautiful, I think,
before he was willing. Also, when he was in, I
brought him acquainted with the damsels that
were of the place; but he was ashamed to make
himself much for company. He desired much to
be alone; yet he always loved good talk, and often
would get behind the screen to hear it. He also
loved much to see ancient things, and to be pondering
them in his mind. He told me, afterwards,
that he loved to be in those two houses from which
he came last; to wit, at the gate, and that of the
Interpreter; but that he durst not be so bold as to
ask.</p>

<p>When we went also from the House Beautiful,
down the hill into the Valley of Humiliation, he
went down as well as ever I saw a man in my life:
for he cared not how mean he was, so he might
be happy at last. Yea, I think there was a kind of
sympathy betwixt that valley and him; for I
never saw him better in all his pilgrimage than
when he was in that valley.</p>

<p>Here he would lie down, embrace the ground,
and kiss the very flowers that grew in this valley.
He would now be up every morning by break of
day, tracing and walking to and fro in this valley.</p>

<p>But when he was come to the entrance of the
Valley of the Shadow of Death, I thought I should
have lost my man: not for that he had any inclination
to go back&mdash;that he always abhorred; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
he was ready to die for fear. "Oh, the hobgoblins
will have me! the hobgoblins will have me!"
cried he, and I could not beat him out of it. He
made such a noise and such an outcry here, that,
had they but heard him, it was enough to encourage
them to come and fall upon us.</p>

<p>But this I took very great notice of, that this
valley was as quiet while we went through it as
ever I knew it before or since. I suppose those
enemies here had now a special check from our
Lord, and a command not to meddle until Mr.
Fearing had passed over it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FEARING AT VANITY FAIR</div>

<p>It would be too tedious to tell you of all, I will
therefore only mention a passage or two more.
When he was come at Vanity Fair, I thought he
would have fought with all the men in the fair.
I feared there we should both have been knocked
on the head, so hot was he against their fooleries.
Upon the Enchanted Ground he was also very
wakeful. But, when he was come at the river
where was no bridge, there again he was in a
heavy case. Now, now, he said, he should be
drowned for ever, and so never see that face with
comfort that he had come so many miles to behold.</p>

<p>And here also I took notice of what was very
remarkable: the water of that river was lower at
this time than ever I saw it in all my life: so he
went over at last, not much above wetshod.
When he was going up to the gate, I began to
take leave of him, and to wish him a good reception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
above. So he said, "I shall, I shall." Then
parted we asunder, and I saw him no more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Then it seems he was well at last?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Yes, yes; I never had a doubt about
him. He was a man of choice spirit; only he was
always kept very low, and that made his life so
burthensome to himself and so troublesome to
others. He was, above many, tender of sin: he
was so afraid of doing injuries to others, that he
often would deny himself of that which was lawful
because he would not offend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> But what should be the reason that such
a good man should be all his days so much in the
dark?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> There are two sorts of reasons for it.
One is, the wise God will have it so; some must
pipe, and some must weep. Now Mr. Fearing
was one that played upon this bass. He and his
fellows sound the sackbut, whose notes are more
doleful than the notes of other music are; though,
indeed, some say the bass is the ground of music.
And, for my part, I care not at all for that profession
which begins, not in heaviness of mind. The
first string that the musician usually touches is the
bass, when he intends to put all in tune. God also
plays upon this string first, when He sets the
soul in tune for Himself. Only here was the
imperfection of Mr. Fearing: he could play upon
no other music but this till toward his latter end.</p>

<p>I make bold to talk thus in figures, for the ripening
of the wits of young readers, and because, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the book of the Revelation, the saved are compared
to a company of musicians, that play upon
their trumpets and harps, and sing their songs
before the throne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> He was a very zealous man, as one may
see by the relation which you have given of him.
Difficulties, lions, or Vanity Fair he feared not
at all; it was only sin, death, and hell that were
to him a terror, because he had some doubts about
his interest in that Celestial Country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> You say right: those were the things
that were his troublers, and they, as you have
well observed, arose from the weakness of his mind
thereabout, not from weakness of spirit as to the
practical part of a pilgrim's life. I dare believe
that, as the proverb is, he would have bit a firebrand,
had it stood in his way; but the things
with which he was oppressed no man ever yet
could shake off with ease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> Then said Christiana, "This relation of
Mr. Fearing has done me good. I thought nobody
had been like me; but I see there was some semblance
betwixt this good man and I: only we
differed in two things. His troubles were so great
that they broke out; but mine I kept within.
His also lay so hard upon him, they made him that
he could not knock at the houses provided for
entertainment; but my trouble was always such
as made me knock the louder."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> If I might also speak my heart, I must say
that something of him has also dwelt in me; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
I have ever been more afraid of the lake, and the
loss of a place in Paradise, than I have been of the
loss of other things. Oh, thought I, may I have
the happiness to have a habitation there, it is
enough, though I part with all the world to win it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matt.</span> Then said Matthew, "Fear was one thing
that made me think that I was far from having
that within me which makes me sure of being
saved. But if it were so with such a good man as
he, why may it not also go well with me?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> "No fears, no grace," said James,
"Though there is not always grace where there
is the fear of hell, yet, to be sure, there is no grace
where there is no fear of God."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Well said, James; thou hast hit the
mark. For the fear of God is the beginning of
wisdom; and, to be sure, they that want the
beginning have neither middle nor end. But we
will here conclude our discourse of Mr. Fearing,
after we have sent after him this farewell:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Well, Master Fearing, thou didst fear</span><br />
<span class="i1">Thy God, and wast afraid</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of doing anything while here</span><br />
<span class="i1">That would have thee betrayed.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And didst thou fear the lake and pit?</span><br />
<span class="i1">Would others did so too!</span><br />
<span class="i0">For, as for them that want thy wit,</span><br />
<span class="i1">They do themselves undo."</span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">HONEST TELLS OF MR. SELF-WILL</div>

<p>Now I saw that they still went on in their talk;
for, after Mr. Great-heart had made an end with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Mr. Fearing, Mr. Honest began to tell them of
another, but his name was Mr. Self-will. "He
pretended himself to be a pilgrim," said Mr.
Honest, "but I persuade myself he never came in
at the gate that stands at the head of the way."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Had you ever any talk with him about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Yes, more than once or twice; but he
would always be like himself, self-willed. He
neither cared for man, nor argument, nor yet
example; what his mind prompted him to, that
he would do, and nothing else could he be got to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Pray, what principles did he hold?
for I suppose you can tell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> He held that a man might follow the sins
as well as the virtues of pilgrims; and that, if he
did both, he should be certainly saved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> How! If he had said it is possible for
the best to be guilty of the vices, as well as to
partake of the virtues, of pilgrims, he could not
much have been blamed; for, indeed, we are
free from no sin absolutely, but on condition that
we watch and strive. But this, I perceive, is not
the thing; but, if I understood you right, your
meaning is that he was of opinion that it was
allowable so to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Ay, ay, so I mean, and so he believed
and acted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> But what grounds had he for his so
saying?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Why, he said he had the Scripture for his
warrant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HONEST QUOTES SELF-WILL</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Prithee, Mr. Honest, present us with a
few particulars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> So I will. He said, To have to do with
other men's wives had been practiced by David,
God's beloved; and therefore he could do it.
He said, To have more women than one was a
thing that Solomon practiced; and therefore he
could do it. He said that Sarah lied, and so did
Rahab; and therefore he could do it. He said
that the disciples went at the bidding of their
Master, and took away the owner's ass; and therefore
he could do so too. He said that Jacob got
the inheritance of his father in a way of guile and
cheating; and therefore he could do so too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Highly base, indeed! And you are
sure he was of this opinion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> I have heard him plead for it, bring
Scripture for it, bring argument for it, and so on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> An opinion that is not fit to be with
any allowance in the world!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> You must understand me rightly: he did
not say that <i>any</i> man might do this; but that they
who had the virtues of those that did such things,
might also do the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> But what more false than such a conclusion?
For this is as much as to say that,
because good men heretofore have sinned through
weakness or forgetfulness, therefore he had an
allowance to do it of a purpose; or if, because a
child, by the blast of the wind, or for that it
stumbled at a stone, fell down and defiled itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
in the mire, therefore he might wilfully lie down
and wallow like a boar therein. Who could have
thought that any one could so far have been
blinded by the power of sin. But what is written
must be true: they "stumble at the Word, being
disobedient; whereunto also they were appointed."
His supposing that such may have the godly man's
virtues, who accustom themselves to their vices, is
also a delusion as strong as the other. To eat up
the sin of God's people as a dog licks up filth, is
no sign of one that is possessed with their virtues.
Nor can I believe that one who is of this opinion
can have faith or love in him. But I know you
have made strong objections against him: prithee,
what can he say for himself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Why, he says, "To do this openly and
by way of opinion, seems abundantly more honest
than to do it and yet hold contrary to it in
opinion."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> A very wicked answer. For, though
to let loose the bridle to lusts while our opinions
are against such things is bad; yet to sin, and
plead a toleration so to do, is worse. The one
stumbles beholders accidentally, the other <i>pleads</i>
them into the snare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> There are many of this man's mind, that
have not this man's mouth; and that makes
going on pilgrimage of so little esteem as it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> You have said the truth, and it is to
be lamented; but he that feareth the King of
Paradise shall come out of them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chr.</span> There are strange opinions in the world.
I know one that said it was time enough to turn
from sin when they come to die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Such are not overwise. That man
would have been loth, might he have had a week
to run twenty miles in for his life, to have deferred
that journey to the last hour of that
week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> You say right; and yet the most of them
who count themselves pilgrims do indeed do thus.
I am, as you see, an old man, and have been a
traveller in this road many a day, and I have
taken notice of many things. I have seen some
that have set out as if they would drive all the
world afore them, who yet have, in a few days,
died as they in the wilderness, and so never got
sight of the promised land. I have seen some
that have promised nothing at first, setting out
to be pilgrims, and that one would have thought
could not have lived a day, that have yet proved
very good pilgrims. I have seen some that have
run hastily forward, that again have, after a little
time, run just as fast back again. I have seen
some who have spoken very well of a pilgrim's
life at first, that, after a while, have spoken as
much against it. I have heard some, when they
first set out for Paradise, say positively there is
such a place, who, when they have been almost
there, have come back again, and said there is
none. I have heard some boast what they would
do in case they should be opposed, that have,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
even at a false alarm, fled faith, the pilgrim's
way, and all.</p>

<p>Now, as they were thus in their way, there came
one running to meet them, and said, "Gentlemen,
and you of the weaker sort, if you love life, shift
for yourselves, for the robbers are before you."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> "They be the three that set upon Little-Faith
heretofore. Well," said he, "we are ready
for them."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PILGRIMS PROCEED</div>

<p>So they went on their way. Now they looked
at every turning when they should have met with
the villains; but whether they heard of Mr.
Great-heart, or whether they had some other
game, they came not up to the pilgrims.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>ENTERTAINED BY GAIUS.</h3>


<p>Christiana then wished for an inn for
herself and her children, because they
were weary.</p>

<p>Then said Mr. Honest, "There is one a little
before us, where a very honorable disciple, one
Gaius, dwells." So they all concluded to turn
in thither, and the rather because the old gentleman
gave him so good a report. When they
came to the door, they went in, not knocking,
for folks use not to knock at the door of an inn.
Then they called for the master of the house,
and he came to them; so they asked if they might
lie there that night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gaius.</span> Yes, gentlemen, if you be true men, for
my house is for none but pilgrims.</p>

<p>Then were Christiana, Mercy, and the boys
the more glad, for that the Innkeeper was a lover
of pilgrims. So they called for rooms, and he
showed them one for Christiana, and her children,
and Mercy, and another for Mr. Great-heart and
the old gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> "Good Gaius, what hast thou for supper?
for these pilgrims have come far to-day, and
are weary."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gaius.</span> "It is late, so we cannot conveniently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
go out to seek food; but such as we have you
shall be welcome to, if that will content."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> We will be content with what thou
hast in the house; forasmuch as I have proved
thee, thou art never without that which is suitable.</p>

<p>Then he went down and spake to the cook,
whose name was Taste-that-which-is-good, to
get ready supper for so many pilgrims. This
done, he came up again, saying, "Come, my good
friends, you are welcome to me, and I am glad
that I have a house to entertain you in; and,
while supper is making ready, if you please, let
us entertain one another with some good talking
together."</p>

<p>So they all said, "Content."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gaius.</span> "Whose wife is this aged matron? and
whose daughter is this young damsel?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> The woman is the wife of one Christian,
a pilgrim of former times; and these are his four
children. The maid is one of her acquaintance,
one that she hath persuaded to come with her on
pilgrimage. The boys take all after their father,
and wish to tread in his steps; yea, if they do but
see any place where the old pilgrim hath lain, or
any print of his foot, it bringeth joy to their hearts,
and they are eager to lie or tread in the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAMILY OF THE CHRISTIANS</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gaius.</span> "Is this Christian's wife, and are these
Christian's children? I knew your husband's
father; yea, also his father's father. Many have
been good of this stock; their ancestors dwelt first
at Antioch. Christian's ancestors, the early fathers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
from whom he came (I suppose you have heard
your husband talk of them) were very worthy men.
They have, above any that I know, showed themselves
men of great virtue and courage, for the
Lord of pilgrims, His ways, and them that loved
Him. I have heard of many of your husband's
relations that have stood all trials for the sake of
the truth. Stephen, who was one of the first of the
family from whence your husband sprang, was
knocked on the head with stones. James, another
of this generation, was slain with the edge of the
sword. To say nothing of Paul and Peter, men
anciently of the family from whence your husband
came; there was Ignatius, who was cast to the lions;
Romanus, whose flesh was cut by pieces from
his bones; and Polycarp, that played the man
in the fire; there was he that was hanged up in a
basket in the sun for the wasps to eat; and he
whom they put into a sack, and cast him into the
sea to be drowned. It would be utterly impossible
to count up all of that family who have suffered
injuries and death for the love of a pilgrim's life.
Nor can I but be glad to see that thy husband has
left behind him four such boys as these. I hope
they will bear out their father's name, and tread
in their father's steps, and come to their father's
end."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Indeed, sir, they are likely lads; they
seem to choose heartily their father's ways.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gaius.</span> That is it that I said; wherefore Christian's
family is like still to spread abroad upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
face of the ground, and yet to be numerous upon
the face of the earth. Wherefore let Christiana
look out some damsels for her sons, to whom they
may be married, etc., that the name of their father
and the house of his family may never be forgotten
in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> 'Tis pity this family should fall and die
out of the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gaius.</span> Fall it cannot, but be diminished it
may; but let Christiana take my advice, and that
is the way to uphold it. "And Christiana,"
said this Innkeeper, "I am glad to see thee and
thy friend Mercy together here, a lovely couple.
And may I advise, take Mercy into a nearer
relation to thee; if she will, let her be given to
Matthew, thy eldest son. It is the way to give
you a family in the earth."</p>

<p>So this match was arranged, and in process of
time they were married; but more of that hereafter.</p>

<p>Gaius also proceeded, and said, "I will now
speak on the behalf of women, to take away their
reproach. For as death and the curse came into
the world by a woman, so also did life and health:
'God sent forth His Son, born of a woman.' I
will say again, that when the Saviour was come,
women rejoiced in Him before either man or
angel. I read not that man ever gave unto Christ
so much as one penny; but the women followed
Him, and ministered to Him of their substance.
'Twas a woman that washed His feet with tears,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
and a woman that anointed His body to the burial.
They were women that wept when He was going
to the cross, and women that followed Him from
the cross; and that sat over against the sepulchre
when He was buried. They were women that
were first with Him at His resurrection-morn,
and women that brought tidings first to His
disciples that He was risen from the dead. Women,
therefore, are highly favored, and show by
these things that they are sharers with us in the
grace of life."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SUPPER AT GAIUS'S HOUSE</div>

<p>Now the cook sent up to signify that supper
was almost ready, and sent one to lay the cloth,
the dishes, and to set the salt and bread in order.</p>

<p>Then said Matthew, "The sight of this cloth,
and of this forerunner of the supper, awaketh
in me a greater appetite to my food than I had
before."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gaius.</span> So let all teaching truth to thee in this
life awaken in thee a greater desire to sit at the
supper of the great King in His kingdom; for all
preaching, books, and services here, are but as
the laying of the dishes, and as setting of salt
upon the board, when compared with the feast
which our Lord will make for us when we come
to His house.</p>

<p>So supper came up. And first a heave-shoulder
and a wave-breast were set on the table before
them, to show that they must begin their meal
with prayer and praise to God. The heave-shoulder
David lifted up his heart to God with;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
and with the wave-breast, where his heart lay,
he used to lean upon his harp when he played.
These two dishes were very fresh and good, and
they all ate heartily well thereof.</p>

<p>The next they brought up was a bottle of wine,
red as blood. So Gaius said to them, "Drink
freely: this is the true juice of the vine, that
makes glad the heart of God and man." So they
drank and were merry. The next was a dish
of milk, well crumbed; but Gaius said, "Let
the boys have that, that they may grow thereby."</p>

<p>Then they brought up in course of dish of butter
and honey. Then said Gaius, "Eat freely of
this, for this is good to cheer up and strengthen
your judgments and understandings. This was
our Lord's dish when He was a child: 'Butter
and honey shall He eat, that He may know to
refuse the evil and choose the good.'"</p>

<p>Then they brought them up a dish of apples,
and they were very good tasted fruit. Then
said Matthew, "May we eat apples, since they were
such by and with which the serpent deceived
our first mother Eve?"</p>

<p>Then said Gaius:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Apples were they with which we were beguiled;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Yet sin, not apples, hath our souls defiled.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Apples forbid, if ate, corrupt the blood;</span><br />
<span class="i0">To eat such, when commanded, does us good.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Drink of His flagons, then, thou Church, His dove,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And eat His apples who are sick of love."</span>
</div>

<p>Then said Matthew, "I made the objection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
because I, a while since, was sick with eating of
fruit."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gaius.</span> Forbidden fruit will make you sick;
but not what our Lord has allowed.</p>

<p>While they were thus talking, they were presented
with another dish, and it was a dish of
nuts. Then said some at the table, "Nuts spoil
tender teeth, specially the teeth of children;"
which, when Gaius heared, he said;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Hard texts are nuts (I will not call them cheaters),</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whose shells do keep their kernels from the eaters;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ope then the shells, and you shall have the meat:</span><br />
<span class="i0">They here are brought for you to crack and eat."</span>
</div>

<p>Then were they very merry, and sat at the
table a long time, talking of many things. Then
said the old gentleman, "My good landlord, while
we are cracking your nuts, if you please, do you
open this riddle;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"A man there was, though some did count him mad,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The more he cast away, the more he had."</span>
</div>

<p>Then they all gave good heed, wondering what
good Gaius would say: so he sat still awhile, and
then thus replied:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"He that bestows his goods upon the poor</span><br />
<span class="i0">Shall have as much again, and ten times more."</span>
</div>

<p>Then said Joseph, "I dare say, sir, I did not
think you could have found it out."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Gaius, "I have been trained up in
this way a great while: nothing teaches like experience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
I have learned of my Lord to be kind,
and have found by experience that I have gained
thereby. 'There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth;
and there is that withholdeth more than
is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.' 'There is that
maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing; there is
that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">MERCY AND MATTHEW</div>

<p>Then Samuel whispered to Christiana, his
mother, and said, "Mother, this is a very good
man's house; let us stay here a good while, and
let my brother Matthew be married here to Mercy
before we go any farther." The which Gaius,
the host, overhearing, said, "With a very good
will, my child."</p>

<p>So they stayed there more than a month, and
Mercy was given to Matthew to wife. While they
stayed here, Mercy, as her custom was, would be
making coats and garments to give to the poor,
by which she brought up a very good report upon
the pilgrims.</p>

<p>But to return again to our story. After supper,
the lads desired a bed, for that they were weary
with travelling. Then Gaius called to show them
their chamber; but said Mercy, "I will have them
to bed." So she had them to bed, and they slept
well; but the rest sat up all night, for Gaius and
they were such suitable company, that they could
not tell how to part.</p>

<p>Then, after much talk of their Lord, themselves,
and their journey, old Mr. Honest, he that put
forth the riddle to Gaius, began to nod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>Then said Great-heart, "What, sir! you begin to
be drowsy? Come, rub up. Now, here's a riddle
for you."</p>

<p>Then said Mr. Honest, "Let us hear it."</p>

<p>Then said Mr. Great-heart:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"He that will kill, must first be overcome;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who live abroad would, first must die at home."</span>
</div>

<p>"Ha!" said Mr. Honest, "it is a hard one; hard
to explain, and harder to do. But come, landlord,"
said he, "I will, if you please, leave my
part to you: do you expound it, and I will hear
what you say."</p>

<p>"No," said Gaius, "it was put to you, and it is
expected you should answer it." Then said the
old gentleman:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"He first by grace must conquered be,</span><br />
<span class="i1">That sin would mortify;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And who that lives would convince me,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Unto himself must die."</span>
</div>

<p>Thus they sat talking till break of day. Now,
when the family were up, Christiana bade her
son James read a chapter; so he read the fifty-third
of Isaiah.</p>

<p>"Well," said Gaius, "now you are here, and
since, as I know Mr. Great-heart is good at his
weapons, if you please, after we have refreshed
ourselves we will walk into the fields, to see if
we can do any good. About a mile from hence
there is one Slay-good, a giant, that doth much
annoy the King's highway in these parts; and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
know whereabout his haunt is. He is master
of a number of thieves: 'twould be well if we
could clear these parts of him."</p>

<p>So they consented and went; Mr. Great-heart
with his sword, helmet, and shield, and the rest
with spears and staves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SLAY-GOOD DESTROYED</div>

<p>When they were come to the place where he
was, they found him with one Feeble-minded
in his hands, whom his servants had brought
unto him, having taken him in the way. Now
the giant was picking his pockets, with a purpose
after that to pick his bones; for he was of the
nature of flesh-eaters.</p>

<p>Well, so soon as he saw Mr. Great-heart and
his friends at the mouth of his cave with their
weapons, he demanded what they wanted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> We want thee, for we are come to
revenge the quarrel of the many that thou hast
slain of the pilgrims, when thou has dragged them
out of the King's highway; wherefore come out
of thy cave.</p>

<p>So he armed himself and came out; and to
battle they went, and fought for above an hour,
and then stood still to take wind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Slay.</span> Then said the giant, "Why are you
here on my ground?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> To revenge the blood of pilgrims,
as I told thee before.</p>
<div class="sidenote">FEEBLE-MIND RESCUED</div>

<p>So they went to it again, and the giant made
Mr. Great-heart give back; but he came up
again, and in the greatness of his mind he let fly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
with such stoutness at the giant's head and sides,
that he made him let his weapon fall out of his
hand. So he smote him, and slew him, and cut
off his head, and brought it away to the inn. He
also took Feeble-mind, the pilgrim, and brought
him with him to his lodgings. When they
were come home, they showed his head to the
family, and then set it up as they had done others
before, for a terror to those that should attempt
to do as he hereafter.</p>

<p>Then they asked Mr. Feeble-mind how he fell
into his hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feeble.</span> Then said the poor man, "I am a sickly
man, as you see; and because death did usually
once a day knock at my door, I thought I should
never be well at home: so I betook myself to a
pilgrim's life, and have travelled hither from
the town of Uncertain, where I and my father
were born. I am a man of no strength at all of
body, nor yet of mind, but would, if I could,
though I can but crawl, spend my life in the
pilgrims' way. When I came at the gate that
is at the head of the way, the Lord of that place
did entertain me freely; neither objected He
against my weakly looks, nor against my feeble
mind, but gave me such things as were necessary
for my journey, and bid me hope to the end.
When I came to the house of the Interpreter, I
received much kindness there; and because the
Hill Difficulty was judged too hard for me, I
was carried up that by one of his servants. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
I have found much relief from pilgrims:
though none were willing to go so softly as I am
forced to do, yet still as they came on they bid
me be of good cheer, and said that it was the will
of their Lord that comfort should be given to
the feeble-minded, and so went on their own pace.
When I was come to Assault Lane, then this giant
met with me, and bid me prepare for an encounter.
But, alas! feeble one that I was, I had more need
of a cordial; so he came up and took me. I
believed not that he should kill me. Also when
he got me into his den, since I went not with
him willingly, I believed I should come out alive
again; for I have heard that not any pilgrim
that is taken captive by violent hands, if he keeps
heart-whole towards his Master, is, by the laws of
Providence, to die by the hands of the enemy.
Robbed I looked to be, and robbed to be sure
I am; but I have, as you see, escaped with life,
for the which I thank my King as author, and
you as the means. Other brunts I also look for;
but this I have resolved on&mdash;to wit, to run when
I can, to go when I cannot run, and to creep when
I cannot go. As to the principal thing, I thank
Him that loves me, I am fixed: my way is before
me, my mind is beyond the river that has no
bridge, though I am, as you see, but of a feeble
mind."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Then said old Mr. Honest, "Have not
you some time ago been acquainted with one Mr.
Fearing, a pilgrim?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span><span class="smcap">Feeble.</span> Acquainted with him! yes; he came
from the town of Stupidity, which lies four degrees
northward of the City of Destruction, and as
many off of where I was born; yet we were well
acquainted, for indeed he was my uncle, my
father's brother. He and I have been much of a
temper: he was a little shorter than I, but yet
we were much of a complexion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> I perceive you know him, and I am apt
to believe also that you are related one to another;
for you have his whitely look, a cast
like his with your eye, and your speech is much
alike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feeble.</span> Most have said so that have known
us both; and besides, what I have read in him
I have for the most part found in myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gaius.</span> "Come, sir," said good Gaius, "be of
good cheer: you are welcome to me and to my
house. What thou hast a mind to, call for freely;
and what thou wouldst have my servants do for
thee, they will do it with a ready mind."</p>

<p>Then said Mr. Feeble-mind, "This is an unexpected
favor, and as the sun shining out of a
very dark cloud. Did Giant Slay-good intend
me this favor when he stopped me, and resolved
to let me go no farther? Did he intend that,
after he had rifled my pockets, I should go to
Gaius, mine host? Yet so it is."</p>

<p>Now, just as Feeble-mind and Gaius were thus
in talk, there came one running, and called at the
door, and said, that "About a mile and a half off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
there was one Mr. Not-right, a pilgrim, struck
dead upon the place where he was, with a thunderbolt."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feeble.</span> "Alas!" said Mr. Feeble-mind, "is
he slain? He overtook me some days before I
came so far as hither, and would be my company-keeper.
He also was with me when Slay-good,
the giant, took me; but he was nimble of his heels,
and escaped; but it seems he escaped to die,
and I was taken to live.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"What, one would think, doth seek to slay outright,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ofttimes delivers from the saddest plight,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That very Providence, whose face is death,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Doth ofttimes to the lowly life bequeath.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I was taken, he did escape and flee;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Hands crossed gives death to him, and life to me."</span>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">PH&OElig;BE AND JAMES</div>

<p>Now, about this time, Matthew and Mercy were
married; also Gaius gave his daughter Ph&oelig;be
to James, Matthew's brother, to wife; after
which time, they yet stayed about ten days at
Gaius's house, spending their time and the seasons
like as pilgrims use to do.</p>

<p>When they were to depart, Gaius made them a
feast, and they did eat and drink and were merry.
Now, the hour was come that they must be gone,
wherefore Mr. Great-heart called for the bill of
charges. But Gaius told him that at his house it
was not the custom of pilgrims to pay for their
entertainment. He boarded them by the year,
but looked for his pay from the Good Samaritan,
who had promised him, at His return, whatsoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
charge he was at with them, faithfully to repay
him.</p>

<p>Then said Mr. Great-heart to him,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Beloved, thou doest faithfully, whatsoever
thou doest to the brethren and to strangers,
which have borne witness of thy liberal giving
before the Church; whom if thou yet bring forward
on their journey after a godly sort, thou
shalt do well.</p>

<p>Then Gaius took his leave of them all, and his
children, and particularly of Mr. Feeble-mind.
He also gave him something to drink by the way.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Feeble-mind, when they were going
out of the door, made as if he intended to linger.
The which when Mr. Great-heart espied, he said,
"Come, Mr. Feeble-mind, pray do you go along
with us: I will be your conductor, and you shall
fare as the rest."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feeble.</span> Alas! I want a suitable companion.
You are all lusty and strong, but I, as you see,
am weak; I choose, therefore, rather to come
behind, lest, by reason of my many weaknesses,
I should be both a burden to myself and to you.
I am, as I said, a man of a weak and feeble mind,
and shall be injured and made weak at that which
others can bear. I shall like no laughing; I
shall like no gay attire; I shall like no unprofitable
questions. Nay, I am so weak a man as
to be harmed with that which others have a
liberty to do. I do not yet know all the truth;
I am a very ignorant Christian man. Sometimes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
if I hear any rejoice in the Lord, it troubles me,
because I cannot do so too. It is with me as it
is with a weak man among the strong, or as with
a sick man among the healthy, or as a lamp despised.
"He that is ready to slip with his feet
is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that
is at ease;" so that I know not what to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> "But, brother," said Mr. Great-heart,
"I have it in my work to comfort the feeble-minded
and to support the weak. You must
needs go along with us: we will wait for you; we
will lend you our help; we will deny ourselves
of some things, for your sake; we will not enter
into doubtful questions before you! we will be
made all things to you, rather than you shall be
left behind."</p>

<p>Now, all this while they were at Gaius's door,
and, behold, as they were thus in the heat of
their discourse, Mr. Ready-to-halt came by,
with his crutches in his hands; and he also was
going on pilgrimage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feeble.</span> Then said Mr. Feeble-mind to him,
"How camest thou hither? I was but now complaining
that I had not a suitable companion,
but thou art according to my wish. Welcome,
welcome, good Mr. Ready-to-halt; I hope thou
and I may be some help."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ready.</span> "I shall be glad of thy company,"
said the other; "and, good Mr. Feeble-mind,
rather than we will part, since we are thus happily
met, I will lend thee one of my crutches."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span><span class="smcap">Feeble.</span> "Nay," said he, "though I thank
thee for thy good-will, I am not inclined to halt
before I am lame. Howbeit, I think, when occasion
is, it may help me against a dog."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ready.</span> If either myself or my crutches can
do thee a pleasure, we are both at thy command,
good Mr. Feeble-mind.</p>

<p>Thus, therefore, they went on. Mr. Great-heart
and Mr. Honest went before, Christiana
and her children went next, and Mr. Feeble-mind
came behind, and Mr. Ready-to-halt with
his crutches. Then said Mr. Honest,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Pray, sir, now that we are upon the road,
tell us some profitable things of some that have
gone on pilgrimage before us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REVIEWS OTHER PILGRIMAGES</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> With a good will. I suppose you have
heard how Christian of old did meet with Apollyon
in the Valley of Humiliation, and also what
hard work he had to go through the Valley of the
Shadow of Death. Also I think you cannot but
have heard how Faithful was put to it by
Madam Wanton, with Adam the first, with
one Discontent, and Shame; four as deceitful
villains as a man can meet with upon the
road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Yes, I believe I have heard of all this;
but, indeed, good Faithful was hardest put to it
with Shame: he was an unwearied one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Ay; for, as the pilgrim well said, he
of all men had the wrong name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> But pray, sir, where was it that Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
and Faithful met Talkative? That same was
also a notable one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> He was a confident fool; yet many
follow his ways.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> He had liked to have deceived Faithful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Ay, but Christian put him into a way
quickly to find him out.</p>

<p>Thus they went on till they came to the place
where Evangelist met with Christian and Faithful,
and foretold them what should befall them at
Vanity Fair. Then said their guide, "Hereabouts
did Christian and Faithful meet with
Evangelist, who foretold them of their troubles
which they should meet with at Vanity Fair."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Say you so? I dare say it was a hard
chapter, then, that he did read unto them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> It was; but he gave them encouragement
withal. But what do we talk of them?
they were a couple of lion-like men: they had
set their faces like flint. Do not you remember
how undaunted they were when they stood
before the judge?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Well. Faithful bravely suffered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> So he did, and as brave things came
on't; for Hopeful and some others, as the story
relates it, were converted by his death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Well, but pray go on, for you are well acquainted
with things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Above all that Christian met with after
he had passed through Vanity Fair, one By-ends
was the arch one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> By-ends! what was he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> A very arch fellow&mdash;a downright deceiver;
one that would be religious, which way
soever the world went; but so cunning that he
would be sure never to lose or suffer for it. He
had his mode of religion for every fresh occasion,
and his wife was as good at it as he. And he
would turn and change from opinion to opinion;
yea, and plead for so doing, too. But, as far as
I could learn, he came to an ill end with his by-ends;
nor did I ever hear that any of his children
were ever of any esteem with any that truly
feared God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEY ARRIVE AT VANITY FAIR</div>

<p>Now, by this time they were come within sight
of the town of Vanity, where Vanity Fair is kept.
So, when they saw that they were so near the
town, they consulted with one another how they
should pass through the town; and some said
one thing, and some another. At last Mr. Great-heart
said, "I have, as you may understand,
often been a conductor of pilgrims through this
town. Now, I am acquainted with one Mr.
Mnason, a Cyprusian by nature, an old disciple,
at whose house we may lodge. If you think
good," said he, "we will turn in there."</p>

<div class="sidenote">MNASON ENTERTAINS PILGRIMS</div>

<p>"Content," said old Honest; "Content," said
Christiana; "Content," said Mr. Feeble-mind;
and so they said all. Now, you must think it
was eventide by that they got to the outside of
the town; but Mr. Great-heart knew the way
to the old man's house. So thither they came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
and he called at the door; and the old man within
knew his tongue so soon as ever he heard it; so
he opened the door, and they all came in. Then
said Mnason, their host, "How far have ye come
to-day?"</p>

<p>So they said, "From the house of Gaius, our
friend."</p>

<p>"I promise you," said he, "you have come a
good stitch: you may well be weary. Sit down."
So they sat down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Then said their guide, "Come, what
cheer, sirs? I dare say you are welcome to my
friend."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mnas.</span> "I also," said Mr. Mnason, "do bid
you welcome; and whatever you want, do but
say, and we will do what we can to get it for you."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Our great want a while since was a resting-place
and good company, and now I hope we have
both.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mnas.</span> For resting-place, you see what it is;
but for good company, that will appear in the
trial.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> "Well," said Great-heart, "will you
have the pilgrims up into their lodging?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mnas.</span> "I will," said Mr. Mnason. So he had
them up to their several places, and also showed
them a very fair dining-room, where they might
be, and sup together, until time should come to go
to rest.</p>

<p>Now, when they were set in their places, and
were a little cheery after their journey, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Honest asked his landlord if there were any store
of good people in the town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mnas.</span> We have a few; for, indeed, they are
but a few when compared with them on the other
side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> But how shall we do to see some of them?
for the sight of good men to them that are going
on pilgrimage is like the appearing of the moon
and stars to them that are sailing upon the seas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRIENDS CALL ON THE PILGRIMS</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mnas.</span> Then Mr. Mnason stamped with his
foot, and his daughter Grace came up. So he
said unto her, "Grace, go you, tell my friends,
Mr. Contrite, Mr. Holy-man, Mr. Love-saint, Mr.
Dare-not-lie, and Mr. Penitent, that I have a
friend or two at my house who have a mind
this evening to see them." So Grace went to
call them, and they came; and, after salutation
made, they sat down together at the table.</p>

<p>Then said Mr. Mnason, their landlord, "My
neighbors, I have, as you see, a company of
strangers come to my house: they are pilgrims;
they come from afar, and are going to Mount Zion.
But who," quoth he, "do you think this is?"
pointing with his finger to Christiana. "It is
Christiana, the wife of Christian, that famous
pilgrim who, with Faithful his brother, was so
shamefully handled in our town."</p>

<p>At that they stood amazed, saying, "We little
thought to see Christiana when Grace came to
call us; wherefore this is a very comfortable
surprise." They then asked her of her welfare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
and if these young men were her husband's sons.
And when she told them they were, they said,
"The King whom you love and serve, make you
as your father, and bring you where he is in
peace!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Then Mr. Honest (when they had all
sat down) asked Mr. Contrite and the rest, in
what posture their town was at present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contrite.</span> You may be sure we are full of
hurry in fair-time. 'Tis hard keeping our hearts
and spirits in good order when we are in a cumbered
condition. He that lives in such a place as
this, and has to do with such as we have, has
need of a hint to caution him to take heed, every
moment of the day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> But how are your neighbors for quietness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contr.</span> They are much more moderate now
than formerly. You know how Christian and
Faithful were used at our town; but of late, I
say, they have been far more moderate. I think
the blood of Faithful lieth as a load upon them
till now; for since they burned him they have
been ashamed to burn any more. In those days
we were afraid to walk the street; but now we
can show our heads. Then the name of a Christian
was hated; now, specially in some parts
of our town (for you know our town is large),
religion is counted honorable.</p>

<p>Then said Mr. Contrite to them, "Pray, how
fareth it with you in your pilgrimage? how
stands the country towards you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> It happens to us as it happeneth to wayfaring
men: sometimes our way is clean, sometimes
up-hill, sometimes down-hill: we are seldom
at a certainty. The wind is not always on our
back, nor is every one a friend that we meet
with in the way. We have met with some notable
rubs already, and what are yet behind we
know not; but, for the most part we find it true
that has been talked of, of old, "A good man must
suffer trouble."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contr.</span> You talk of rubs; what rubs have you
met withal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Nay, ask Mr. Great-heart, our guide;
for he can give the best account of that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> We have been beset three or four
times already. First, Christiana and her children
were beset by two ruffians, who, they feared,
would take away their lives. We were beset
by Giant Bloody-man, Giant Maul, and Giant
Slay-good. Indeed, we did rather beset the last,
than were beset of him. And thus it was: After
we had been some time at the house of Gaius
mine host, and of the whole Church, we were
minded upon a time to take our weapons with us,
and go and see if we could light upon any of those
that were enemies to pilgrims; for we heard that
there was a notable one thereabouts. Now Gaius
knew his haunt better than I, because he dwelt
thereabout. So we looked, and looked, till at
last we saw the mouth of his cave; then we were
glad and plucked up our spirits. So we approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
up to his den; and, lo! when we came
there, he had dragged, by mere force, into his
net, this poor man, Mr. Feeble-mind, and was
about to bring him to his end. But, when he
saw us, supposing, as he thought, he had had
another prey, he left the poor man in his house,
and came out. So we fell to it full sore, and he
lustily laid about him; but, in conclusion, he
was brought down to the ground, and his head
cut off, and set up by the wayside, for terror to
such as should after practice such ungodliness.
That I tell you the truth, here is the man himself
to affirm it, who was as a lamb taken out of the
mouth of the lion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feeble.</span> Then said Mr. Feeble-mind, "I found
this true, to my cost and comfort: to my cost,
when he threatened to pick my bones every
moment; and to my comfort, when I saw Mr.
Great-heart and his friends with their weapons
approach so near for my deliverance."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Holy.</span> Then said Mr. Holy-man, "There are
two things that they have need to possess who
go on pilgrimage&mdash;courage and an unspotted life.
If they have not courage, they can never hold
on their way; and if their lives be loose, they
will make the very name of the pilgrim stink."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> Then said Mr. Love-saint, "I hope this
caution is not needful among you. But truly
there are many that go upon the road, who rather
declare themselves strangers to pilgrimage than
strangers and pilgrims in the earth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span><span class="smcap">Dare.</span> Then said Mr. Dare-not-lie, "'Tis true.
They have neither the pilgrim's weed nor the pilgrim's
courage: they go not uprightly, but all
awry with their feet; one shoe goeth inward,
another outward, and their hosen out behind;
there is here a rag, and there a rent, to the disparagement
of their Lord."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pen.</span> "These things," said Mr. Penitent, "they
ought to be troubled for; nor are the pilgrims like
to have that grace upon them and their pilgrim's
progress as they desire, until the way is cleared of
such spots and blemishes."</p>

<p>Thus they sat talking and spending the time
until supper was set upon the table, unto which
they went, and refreshed their weary bodies; so
they went to rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GRACE AND SAMUEL</div>

<p>Now, they stayed in this fair a great while, at
the house of Mnason, who, in process of time, gave
his daughter Grace unto Samuel, Christiana's son,
to wife; and his daughter Martha to Joseph.</p>

<p>The time, as I said, that they stayed here was
long; for it was not now as in former times.
Wherefore the pilgrims grew acquainted with
many of the good people of the town, and did
them what service they could. Mercy, as she
was wont, labored much for the poor; wherefore
their bodies and backs blessed her, and she was
there an ornament to her profession. And to say
the truth for Grace, Ph&oelig;be, and Martha, they
were all of a very good nature, and did much good
in their places. They were also all of them very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
fruitful; so that Christian's name, as was said
before, was like to live in the world.</p>

<p>While they lay here, there came a monster out
of the woods, and slew many of the people of the
town. It would also carry away their children,
and teach them to suck its whelps. Now, no man
in the town durst so much as face this monster,
but all fled when they heard the noise of his
coming.</p>

<p>The monster was like unto no one beast on the
earth. Its body was like a dragon, and it had
seven heads and ten horns. It made great havoc
of children, and yet it was governed by a woman.
This monster gave conditions to men, and such
men as loved their lives more than their souls
accepted of those conditions; so they came under.</p>

<p>Now, this Mr. Great-heart, together with those
that came to visit the pilgrims at Mr. Mnason's
house, entered into a covenant to go and engage
this beast, if perhaps they might deliver the people
of this town from the paws and mouth of this so
devouring a serpent.</p>

<p>Then did Mr. Great-heart, Mr. Contrite, Mr.
Holy-man, Mr. Dare-not-lie, and Mr. Penitent,
with their weapons, go forth to meet him. Now,
the monster was at first very rampant, and looked
upon these enemies with great disdain; but they
so belabored him, being sturdy men-at-arms, that
they made him make a retreat. So they came
home to Mr. Mnason's house again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARTHA AND JOSEPH</div>

<p>The monster, you must know, had his certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
seasons to come out in, and to make his attempts
upon the children of the people of the town. Also,
these seasons did these valiant worthies watch him
in, and did still continually assault him; insomuch
that in process of time he became not only
wounded, but lame. Also he has not made that
havoc of the townsmen's children as formerly he
had done; and it is verily believed by some that
this beast will die of his wounds.</p>

<p>This, therefore, made Mr. Great-heart and his
fellows of great fame in this town; so that many
of the people that wanted their taste of things,
yet had a reverent esteem and respect for them.
Upon this account, therefore, it was that these
pilgrims got not much hurt here. True, there
were some of the baser sort, that could see no
more than a mole, nor understand any more
than a beast; these had no reverence for these
men, and took no notice of their valor or adventures.</p>

<p>Well, the time grew on that the pilgrims must
go on their way; wherefore they prepared for
their journey. They sent for their friends; they
talked with them; they had some time set apart,
therein to commit each other to the protection of
their Prince. There were again that brought
them of such things as they had, that were fit for
the weak and the strong, for the women and the
men, and so laded them with such things as were
necessary. Then they set forward on their way;
and, their friends accompanying them so far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
was convenient, they again committed each other
to the protection of their King, and parted.</p>

<p>They, therefore, that were of the pilgrims' company,
went on, and Mr. Great-heart went before
them. Now, the women and children being weakly,
they were forced to go as they could bear; by which
means, Mr. Ready-to-halt and Mr. Feeble-mind
had more to sympathize with their condition.</p>

<p>When they were gone from the townsmen, and
when their friends had bid them farewell, they
quickly came to the place where Faithful was put
to death. There, therefore, they made a stand,
and thanked Him that had enabled him to bear his
cross so well; and the rather, because they now
found that they had a benefit by such manly
suffering as his was.</p>

<p>They went on, therefore, after this a good way
farther, talking of Christian and Faithful, and how
Helpful joined himself to Christian after that
Faithful was dead.</p>

<p>Now they were come up with the Hill Lucre,
where the silver mine was which took Demas off
from his pilgrimage, and into which, as some think,
By-ends fell and perished; wherefore they considered
that. But, when they were come to the
old monument that stood over against the Hill
Lucre, to wit, the pillar of salt, that stood also
within view of Sodom and its stinking lake, they
marvelled, as did Christian before, that men of
that knowledge and ripeness of wit as they were,
should be so blind as to turn aside here.</p>

<p>I saw now that they went on till they came at
the river that was on this side of the Delectable
Mountains; to the river where the
fine trees grow on both sides, and whose leaves, if
taken inwardly, are good against sickness; where
the meadows are green all the year long, and
where they might lie down safely.</p>

<p>By this river-side, in the meadow, there were
cotes and folds for sheep, a house built for the
nourishing and bringing up of those lambs, the
babes of those women that go on pilgrimage.
Also there was here One that was entrusted with
them, who could have pity, and that could gather
these lambs with His arm, and carry them in His
bosom, and that could gently lead those that were
with young.</p>

<p>Now, to the care of this Man Christiana admonished
her four daughters to commit their little
ones, that by these waters they might be housed,
cared for, helped and nourished, and that none of
them might be lacking in time to come. This
Man, if any of them go astray or be lost, He will
bring them again; He will also bind up that which
was broken, and will strengthen them that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
sick. Here they will never want food and drink
and clothing; here they will be kept from thieves
and robbers; for this Man will die before one of
those committed to His trust shall be lost. Besides,
here they shall be sure to have good nurture
and training, and shall be taught to walk in right
paths; and that, you know, is a favor of no small
account. Also here, as you see, are delicate
waters, pleasant meadows, dainty flowers, variety
of trees, and such as bear wholesome fruit&mdash;fruit
not like that that Matthew ate of, that fell over
the wall out of Beelzebub's garden; but fruit that
giveth health where there is none, and that continueth
and increaseth it where it is. So they
were content to commit their little ones to Him;
and that which was also an encouragement to
them so to do, was, for that all this was to be at
the charge of the King, and so was as an hospital
for young children and orphans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DOUBTING CASTLE</div>

<p>Now they went on. And, when they were come
to By-path Meadow, to the stile over which Christian
went with his fellow Hopeful, when they were
taken by Giant Despair and put into Doubting
Castle, they sat down, and consulted what was
best to be done; to wit, now they were so strong,
and had got such a man as Mr. Great-heart for
their conductor, whether they had not best make
an attempt upon the giant, demolish his castle,
and if there were any pilgrims in it, to set them at
liberty, before they went any farther. So one
said one thing, and another said the contrary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
One questioned if it were lawful to go upon ground
that was not the King's; another said they might
providing their end was good; but Mr. Great-heart
said, "Though that reason given last cannot
be always true, yet I have a commandment to
resist sin, to overcome evil, to fight the good fight
of faith; and, I pray, with whom should I fight
this good fight, if not with Giant Despair? I will
therefore attempt the taking away of his life and
the demolishing of Doubting Castle." Then said
he, "Who will go with me?" Then said old
Honest, "I will." "And so will we, too," said
Christiana's four sons, Matthew, Samuel, Joseph,
and James; for they were young men and strong.
So they left the women in the road, and with them
Mr. Feeble-mind and Mr. Ready-to-halt, with his
crutches, to be their guard until they came back;
for, in that place, though Giant Despair dwelt so
near, they keeping in the road, "a little child
might lead them."</p>

<p>So Mr. Great-heart, old Honest, and the four
young men went to go up to Doubting Castle, to
look for Giant Despair. When they came at the
castle gate, they knocked for entrance with an
unusual noise. At that, the old giant comes to
the gate, and Diffidence his wife follows. Then
said he, "Who and what is he that is so hardy as
after this manner to disturb the Giant Despair?"</p>

<p>Mr. Great-heart replied, "It is I, Great-heart,
one of the King of the Celestial Country's conductors
of pilgrims to their place; and I demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
of thee that thou open thy gates for my entrance;
prepare thyself also to fight, for I am come to take
away thy head, and to demolish Doubting Castle."</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIANT DESPAIR IS BEHEADED</div>

<p>Now, Giant Despair, because he was a giant,
thought no man could overcome him; and again
thought he, "Since heretofore I have made a conquest
of angels, shall Great-heart make me afraid?"
So he harnessed himself with his armor, and went
out. He had a cap of steel upon his head, a
breast-plate of fire girded to him, and he came out
in iron shoes, with a great club in his hand. Then
these six men made up to him, and beset him
behind and before; also when Diffidence, the
giantess, came up to help him, old Mr. Honest cut
her down at one blow. Then they fought for
their lives, and Giant Despair was brought down
to the ground, but was very loath to die. He
struggled hard, and had, as they say, as many
lives as a cat; but Great-heart was his death, for
he left him not till he had severed his head from
his shoulders.</p>

<p>Then they fell to demolishing Doubting Castle,
and that, you know, might with ease be done,
since Giant Despair was dead. They were seven
days in destroying of that; and in it of pilgrims,
they found one Mr. Despondency, almost starved
to death, and one Much-afraid, his daughter:
these two they saved alive. But it would have
made you wonder to have seen the dead bodies
that lay here and there in the castle-yard, and
how full of dead men's bones the dungeon was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>When Mr. Great-heart and his companions had
performed this great work they took Mr. Despondency
and his daughter Much-afraid into their care;
for they were honest people, though they were
prisoners in Doubting Castle to that tyrant Giant
Despair.</p>

<p>They therefore, I say, took with them the head
of the giant (for his body they had buried under a
heap of stones), and down to the road and to their
companions they came, and showed them what
they had done. Now, when Feeble-mind and
Ready-to-halt saw that it was the head of Giant
Despair indeed, they were very jocund and merry.
Now, Christiana, if need was, could play upon the
viol, and her daughter Mercy upon the lute; so,
since they were so merry disposed, she played
them a lesson, and Ready-to-halt would dance.
So he took Despondency's daughter Much-afraid
by the hand, and to dancing they went in the road.
True, he could not dance without one crutch in
his hand; but I promise you he footed it well;
also the girl was to be commended, for she
answered the music handsomely.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Despondency, the music was not so
much to him; he was for feeding rather than
dancing, for that he was almost starved. So
Christiana gave him some of her bottle of spirits
for present relief, and then prepared him something
to eat; and in a little time the old gentleman
came to himself, and began to be finely revived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>Now, I saw in my dream, when all these things
were finished, Mr. Great-heart took the head of
Giant Despair, and set it upon a pole by the highway-side,
right over against the pillar that Christian
erected for a caution to pilgrims that came
after to take heed of entering into his grounds.
Then he writ under it, upon a marble stone, these
verses following:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"This is the head of him whose name only</span><br />
<span class="i0">In former times did pilgrims terrify;</span><br />
<span class="i0">His castle's down, and Diffidence his wife</span><br />
<span class="i0">Brave Mr. Great-heart has bereft of life.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Despondency, his daughter Much-afraid,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Great-heart for them also the man has played.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who hereof doubts, if he'll but cast his eye</span><br />
<span class="i0">Up hither, may his scruples satisfy.</span><br />
<span class="i0">This head also, when doubting cripples dance,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Doth show from fears they have deliverance."</span>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE DELECTABLE MOUNTAINS</div>

<p>When these men had thus bravely showed
themselves against Doubting Castle, and had slain
Giant Despair, they went forward, and went on
till they came to the Delectable Mountains, where
Christian and Hopeful refreshed themselves with
the varieties of the place. They also acquainted
themselves with the shepherds there, who welcomed
them, as they had done Christian before,
unto the Delectable Mountains.</p>

<p>Now, the shepherds seeing so great a train
follow Mr. Great-heart (for with him they were
well acquainted), they said unto him, "Good sir,
you have got a goodly company here; pray,
where did you find all these?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>Then Mr. Great-heart replied:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"First, here is Christiana and her train,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Her sons, and her sons' wives, who, like the wain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Keep by the pole, and do by compass steer</span><br />
<span class="i0">From sin to grace; else they had not been here.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Next, here's old Honest come on pilgrimage,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ready-to-halt too, who I dare engage</span><br />
<span class="i0">True-hearted is, and so is Feeble-mind,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who willing was not to be left behind.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Despondency, good man, is coming after</span><br />
<span class="i0">And so also is Much-afraid his daughter.</span><br />
<span class="i0">May we have entertainment here, or must</span><br />
<span class="i0">We farther go? Let's know whereon to trust."</span>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE SHEPHERDS ENTERTAIN</div>

<p>Then said the shepherds, "This is a comfortable
company. You are welcome to us, for we have
care for the feeble, as well as for the strong. Our
Prince has an eye to what is done, to the least of
these; therefore weakness must not be a block to
our entertainment." So they had them to the
palace door, and then said unto them, "Come in,
Mr. Feeble-mind; come in, Mr. Ready-to-halt;
come in, Mr. Despondency and Mrs. Much-afraid,
his daughter. These, Mr. Great-heart," said the
shepherds to the guide, "we call in by name, for
that they are most subject to draw back; but as
for you and the rest that are strong, we leave you
to your wonted liberty."</p>

<p>Then said Mr. Great-heart, "This day I see that
grace doth shine in your faces, and that you are
my Lord's shepherds indeed; for that you
have not pushed these helpless ones neither
with side nor shoulder, but have rather strewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
their way into the palace with flowers, as you
should."</p>

<p>So the feeble and weak went in, and Mr. Great-heart
and the rest did follow. When they were
also sat down, the shepherds said to those of the
weaker sort, "What is it that you would have?
for," said they, "all things must be managed here
for the supporting of the weak, as well as the
warning of the unruly." So they made them a
feast of things easy of digestion, and that were
pleasant to the palate, and nourishing; the which
when they had received, they went to their rest,
each one separately unto his proper place.</p>

<p>When morning was come, because the mountains
were nigh and the day clear, and because it
was the custom of the shepherds to show the
pilgrims before their departure some rarities;
therefore, after they were ready and had refreshed
themselves, the shepherds took them out into the
fields, and showed them first what they had
showed to Christian before.</p>



<p>Then they had them to some new places. The
first was to Mount Marvel, where they looked,
and beheld a man at a distance that tumbled the
hills about with words. Then they asked the
shepherds what that should mean. So they told
them that that man was the son of Mr. Great-grace
of whom you read in the first part of the records
of the Pilgrim's Progress; and he is set down there
to teach the pilgrims how to believe, or to tumble
out of their ways what difficulties they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
meet with, by faith. Then said Mr. Great-heart,
"I know him; he is a man above many."</p>

<p>Then they had them to another place, called
Mount Innocent; and there they saw a man
clothed all in white, and two men, Prejudice and
Ill-will, continually casting dirt upon them. Now,
behold, the dirt, whatsoever they cast at him,
would in a little time fall off again, and his garment
would look as clear as if no dirt had been
cast thereat. Then said the pilgrims, "What
means this?"</p>

<p>The shepherds answered, "This man is named
Godly-man, and this garment is to show the
innocency of his life. Now, those that throw dirt
at him are such as hate his well-doing; but, as you
see, the dirt will not stick upon his clothes: so it
shall be with him that liveth truly innocently in
the world. Whoever they be that would make
such men dirty, they labor all in vain; for God,
by that a little time is spent, will cause that their
innocence shall break forth as the light, and their
righteousness as the noon-day."</p>

<p>Then they took them, and had them to Mount
Charity, where they showed them a man that had
a bundle of cloth lying before him, out of which
he cut coats and garments for the poor that stood
about him; yet his bundle or roll of cloth was
never the less.</p>

<p>Then said they, "What should this be?"</p>

<p>"This is," said the shepherds, "to show you that
he who has a heart to give of his labor to the poor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
shall never want wherewithal. He that watereth
shall be watered himself. And the cake that the
widow gave to the prophet did not cause that she
had ever the less in her barrel."</p>

<p>They had them also to a place where they saw
one Fool, and one Want-wit, washing of an
Ethiopian, with intention to make him white;
but the more they washed him the blacker he was.
Then they asked the shepherds what that should
mean. So they told them, saying, "Thus shall it
be with the vile person: all means used to get
such an one a good name, shall, in the end tend
but to make him more abominable. Thus it was
with the Pharisees, and so shall it be with all pretenders
to religion."</p>

<p>Then said Mercy, the wife of Matthew, to Christiana
her mother, "Mother, I would, if it might be,
see the hole in the hill, or that commonly called
the By-way to Hell." So her mother brake her
mind to the shepherds. Then they went to the
door: it was in the side of a hill; and they opened
it, and bid Mercy hearken awhile. So she hearkened,
and heard one saying, "Cursed be my father
for holding of my feet back from the way of peace
and life." And another said, "Oh that I had been
torn in pieces before I had, to save my life, lost
my soul!" And another said, "If I were to live
again, how would I deny myself rather than come
to this place!" Then there was as if the very
earth groaned and quaked under the feet of this
young woman for fear; so she looked white, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
came trembling away, saying, "Blessed be he and
she that are delivered from this place."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GREAT GLASS</div>

<p>Now, when the shepherds had shown them all
these things, then they had them back to the
palace, and entertained them with what the house
would afford. But Mercy longed for something
that she saw there, but was ashamed to ask. Her
mother-in-law then asked her what she ailed, for
she looked as one not well. Then said Mercy,
"There is a looking-glass hangs up in the dining-room,
off of which I cannot take my mind; if,
therefore, I have it not, I think I shall be unhappy."
Then said her mother, "I will mention
thy wants to the shepherds, and they will not
deny it thee." But she said, "I am ashamed that
these men should know that I longed." "Nay,
my daughter," said she, "it is no shame, but a
virtue, to long for such a thing as that." So
Mercy said, "Then, mother, if you please, ask the
shepherds if they are willing to sell it."</p>

<p>Now, the glass was one of a thousand. It would
present a man, one way, with his own features
exactly; and, turn it but another way, and it
would show one the very face and likeness of the
Prince of pilgrims Himself. Yea, I have talked
with them that can tell, and they have said that
they have seen the very crown of thorns upon His
head, by looking in that glass; they have therein
also seen the holes in His hands, in His feet, and
in His side. Yea, such an excellency is there in
this glass, that it will show Him to one where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
have a mind to see Him, whether living or dead,
whether in earth or in heaven, whether in a state
of lowliness or in His kingliness, whether coming
to suffer or coming to reign.</p>

<p>Christiana, therefore went to the shepherds
apart&mdash;(now, the names of the shepherds were
Knowledge, Experience, Watchful, and Sincere),&mdash;and
said unto them, "There is one of my
daughters, that I think doth long for something
that she hath seen in this house, and she thinks
that she shall be unhappy if she should by you
be denied."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experience.</span> Call her, call her; she shall
assuredly have what we can help her to. So they
called her, and said to her, "Mercy, what is that
thing thou wouldst have?" Then she blushed,
and said, "The great glass that hangs up in the
dining-room." So Sincere ran and fetched it;
and with a joyful consent it was given her. Then
she bowed her head, and gave thanks, and said,
"By this I know that I have obtained favor in
your eyes."</p>

<p>They also gave to the other young women such
things as they desired, and to their husbands great
praise for that they joined with Great-heart to the
slaying of Giant Despair and the destroying of
Doubting Castle.</p>

<p>About Christiana's neck the shepherds put a
necklace, and so they did about the necks of her
four daughters; also they put ear-rings in their
ears, and jewels on their foreheads.<a name="See_page_357" id="See_page_357"></a></p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">THEY LEAVE THE SHEPHERDS</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>When they were minded to go hence, they let
them go in peace, but gave not to them those
certain cautions which before were given to
Christian and his companion. The reason was,
for that these had Great-heart to be their guide,
who was one that was well acquainted with things,
and so could give them their cautions more seasonably;
that is, even then when the danger was nigh
the approaching. What cautions Christian and
his companion had received of the shepherds, they
had also lost by that the time was come that they
had need to put them in practice. Wherefore,
here was the advantage that this company had
over the other.</p>

<p>From hence they went on singing, and they said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Behold, how fitly are the stages set,</span><br />
<span class="i1">For their relief that pilgrims are become,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And how they us receive without one let<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span><br />
<span class="i1">That make the other life our mark and home!</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What novelties they have, to us they give,</span><br />
<span class="i1">That we, though pilgrims, joyful lives may live;</span><br />
<span class="i0">They do upon us, too, such things bestow,</span><br />
<span class="i1">That show we pilgrims are, where'er we go."</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>When they were gone from the shepherds, they
quickly came to the place where Christian met
with one Turn-away, that dwelt in the town of
Apostasy. Wherefore of him Mr. Great-heart,
their guide, did now put them in mind, saying,
"This is the place where Christian met with one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
Turn-away, who carried with him the character
of his rebellion at his back. And this I have to
say concerning this man: he would hearken to no
counsel, but, once falling, persuasion could not
stop him. When he came to the place where the
Cross and the sepulchre were, he did meet with
one that bid him look there; but he gnashed with
his teeth, and stamped, and said he was resolved
to go back to his own town. Before he came to
the gate, he met with Evangelist, who offered to
lay hands on him, to turn him into the way again.
But this Turn-away resisted him; and having
done much harm unto him, he got away over the
wall, and so escaped his hand."</p>

<div class="sidenote">MEET VALIANT FOR TRUTH</div>

<p>Then they went on; and just at the place where
Little-Faith formerly was robbed, there stood a
man with his sword drawn, and his face all bloody.
Then said Mr. Great-heart, "Who art thou?"
The man made answer, saying, "I am one whose
name is Valiant-for-truth. I am a pilgrim, and
am going to the Celestial City. Now, as I was in
my way, there were three men did beset me, and
propounded unto me these three things: 1.
Whether I would become one of them? 2. Or go
back to the place from whence I came? 3. Or die
upon the place? To the first I answered, I had
been a true man a long season, and therefore it
could not be expected that I should now cast in
my lot with thieves. Then they demanded what
I should say to the second. So I told them that
the place from whence I came, had I not found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
it unsatisfactory I had not forsaken at all; but,
finding it altogether unsuitable to me, and very
unprofitable for me, I forsook it for this way.
Then they asked me what I said to the third.
And I told them my life cost more dear far than
that I should lightly give it away. Besides you
have nothing to do thus to put things to my choice,
wherefore at your peril be it if you meddle. Then
these three, to wit, Wild-head, Inconsiderate, and
Pragmatic, drew their weapons upon me, and I
also drew upon them. So we fell to it, one against
three, for the space of above three hours. They
have left upon me, as you see, some of the marks
of their valor, and have also carried away with
them some of mine. They are but just now gone:
I suppose they might, as the saying is, hear your
horse dash, and so they betook them to flight."</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW VALIANT BORE HIMSELF</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> But here was great odds, three against
one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> 'Tis true; but little or more are
nothing to him that has the truth on his side.
"Though an host should encamp against me,"
said one, "my heart shall not fear: though war
should rise against me, in this will I be confident.
Besides," said he, "I have read in some records
that one man has fought an army; and how many
did Samson slay with the jaw-bone of an ass?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Then said the guide, "Why did you not
cry out, that some might have come in for your
succor?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> So I did, to my King, who, I knew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
could hear me, and afford invisible help; and that
was sufficient for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Then said Great-heart to Mr. Valiant-for-truth,
"Thou hast worthily behaved thyself.
Let me see thy sword." So he showed it him.
When he had taken it in his hand, and looked
thereon a while, he said, "Ha! it is a right Jerusalem
blade."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> It is so. Let a man have one of these
blades, with a hand to wield it and skill to use it,
and he may venture upon an angel with it. He
need not fear its holding, if he can but tell how to
lay on. Its edges will never blunt. It will cut
flesh and bones, and soul and spirit, and all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> But you fought a great while. I wonder
you were not weary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> I fought till my sword did cleave to
my hand; and when they were joined together,
as if a sword grew out of my arm, and when the
blood ran through my fingers, then I fought with
most courage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Thou hast done well; thou hast resisted
unto blood, striving against sin. Thou shalt
abide by us, come in and go out with us, for we are
thy companions.</p>

<p>Then they took him, washed his wounds, and
gave him of what they had, to refresh him; and
so they went on together.</p>

<p>Now, as they went on, because Mr. Great-heart
was delighted in him (for he loved one greatly that
he found to be a man of his own sort), and because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
there were in company them that were feeble and
weak, therefore he questioned with him about
many things; as, first, what countryman he was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> I am of Dark-land; for there I was
born, and there my father and mother are still.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> "Dark-land!" said the guide; "doth
not that lie upon the same coast with the City of
Destruction?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> Yes, it doth. Now, that which
caused me to come on pilgrimage was this. We
had one Mr. Tell-true come into our parts, and he
told it about what Christian had done, that went
from the City of Destruction; namely, how he
had forsaken his wife and children, and had betaken
himself to a pilgrim's life. It was also
reported, and believed, how he had killed a serpent
that did come out to resist him in his journey;
and how he got through to whither he intended.
It was also told what welcome he had at all his
Lord's lodgings, specially when he came to the
gates of the Celestial City; "For there," said the
man, "he was received with sound of trumpet by
a company of Shining Ones." He told also how
all the bells in the City did ring for joy at his
entering in, and what golden garments he was
clothed with; with many other things that now
I shall forbear to relate. In a word, that man so
told the story of Christian and his travels, that my
heart fell into a burning haste to be gone after
him; nor could father or mother stay me. So I
got from them, and am come thus far on my way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span><span class="smcap">Great.</span> You came in at the gate, did you not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> Yes, yes; for the same man also told
us, that all would be nothing if we did not begin
to enter this way at the gate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> "Look you," said the guide to Christiana,
"the pilgrimage of your husband, with
what he has gotten thereby, is spread abroad far
and near."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> Why, is this Christian's wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Yes, that it is, and these also are his
four sons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> What! and going on pilgrimage too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Yes, verily, they are following after.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> It glads me at heart. Good man,
how joyful will he be when he shall see them that
would not go with him, yet to enter after him in
at the gates into the City!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Without doubt it will be a comfort to
him; for, next to the joy of seeing himself there,
it will be a joy to meet there his wife and children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> But, now you are upon that, pray
let me hear your opinion about it. Some make a
question whether we shall know one another when
we are there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VALIANT'S OBSTACLES</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Do they think they shall know themselves,
then? or that they shall rejoice to see
themselves in that happiness? And if they think
they shall know and do this, why not know others,
and rejoice in their welfare also? Again, since
relations are our second self, though that state will
cease there, yet why may it not be wisely concluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
that we shall be more glad to see them
there than to see they are wanting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> Well, I perceive whereabouts you are
as to this. Have you any more things to ask me
about my beginning to come on pilgrimage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Yes. Were your father and mother
willing that you should become a pilgrim?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> Oh, no; they used all means imaginable
to persuade me to stay at home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Why, what could they say against it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> They said it was an idle life; and, if
I myself were not inclined to sloth and laziness,
I would never favor a pilgrim's condition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> And what did they say else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> Why, they told me that it was a
dangerous way: "Yea, the most dangerous way
in the world," said they, "is that which the pilgrims
go."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Did they show you wherein this way is
so dangerous?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> Yes; and that in many particulars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Name some of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VALIANT'S DISCOURAGEMENTS</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> They told me of the Slough of Despond,
where Christian was well-nigh smothered.
They told me that there were archers standing
ready in Beelzebub's castle to shoot them who
should knock at the wicket-gate for entrance.
They told me also of the wood and dark mountains
of the Hill Difficulty; of the lions; and also of the
three giants, Bloody-man, Maul, and Slay-good.
They said moreover that there was a foul fiend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
haunted the Valley of Humiliation, and that
Christian was by him almost bereft of life. "Besides,"
said they, "you must go over the Valley
of the Shadow of Death, where the hobgoblins are,
where the light is darkness, where the way is full
of snares, pits, traps, and gins." They told me
also of Giant Despair, of Doubting Castle, and of
the ruin that the pilgrims met with there. Further,
they said I must go over the Enchanted
Ground, which was dangerous; and that, after all
this, I should find a river, over which I should find
no bridge, and that that river did lie betwixt me
and the Celestial Country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> And was this all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> No. They also told me that this
way was full of deceivers, and of persons that laid
wait there to turn good men out of the path.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> But how did they make that out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> They told me that Mr. Worldly Wiseman
did there lie in wait to deceive. They also
said that there were Formality and Hypocrisy
continually on the road. They said also that By-ends,
Talkative, or Demas would go near to gather
me up; that the Flatterer would catch me in his
net; or that, with green-headed Ignorance, I
would presume to go on to the gate, from whence
he was sent back to the hole that was in the side of
the hill, and made to go the by-way to hell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> I promise you, this was enough to discourage
you; but did they make an end here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> No stay. They told me also of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
that had tried that way of old, and that had gone a
great way therein, to see if they could find something
of the glory there that so many had so much
talked of from time to time; and how they came
back again, and befooled themselves for setting
a foot out of doors in that path, to the satisfaction
of all the country. And they named several that
did so, as Obstinate and Pliable, Mistrust and
Timorous, Turn-away and old Atheist; with several
more, who, they said, had some of them gone
far to see what they could find, but not one of
them found so much advantage by going as
amounted to the weight of a feather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Said they anything more to discourage
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> Yes; they told me of one Mr. Fearing,
who was a pilgrim, and how he found this way
so solitary, that he never had a comfortable hour
therein; also that Mr. Despondency had like to
have been starved therein; yea, and also (which
I had almost forgot) that Christian himself, about
whom there had been such a noise, after all his
ventures for a celestial crown, was certainly
drowned in the Black River, and never went a foot
farther, however it was smothered up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> And did none of these things discourage
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> No; they seemed but as so many
nothings to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> How came that about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> Why, I still believed what Mr. Tell-true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
had said; and that carried me beyond them
all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Then this was your victory, even your
faith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> It was so. I believed, and therefore
came out, got into the way, fought all that set
themselves against me, and, by believing, am
come to this place.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>THE ENCHANTED GROUND.</h3>


<p>By this time they were got to the Enchanted
Ground, where the air naturally tended to
make one drowsy. And that place was
all grown over with briers and thorns, excepting
here and there, where was an enchanted arbor,
upon which if a man sits, or in which if a man
sleeps, it is a question, say some, whether ever he
shall rise or wake again in this world. Over this
forest, therefore, they went, both one and another;
and Mr. Great-heart went before, for that he was
the guide, and Mr. Valiant-for-truth came behind,
being rear-guard, for fear lest peradventure some
fiend, or dragon, or giant, or thief, should fall upon
their rear, and so do mischief. They went on here,
each man with his sword drawn in his hand, for
they knew it was a dangerous place. Also they
cheered up one another as well as they could.
Feeble-mind, Mr. Great-heart commanded, should
come up after him; and Mr. Despondency was
under the eye of Mr. Valiant.</p>

<p>Now, they had not gone far, but a great mist
and darkness fell upon them all, so that they
could scarce, for a great while, see the one the
other; wherefore they were forced, for some time,
to feel for one another by words; for they walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
not by sight. But any one must think that here
was but sorry going for the best of them all; but
how much worse for the women and children, who
both of feet and heart were but tender! Yet so
it was, that through the encouraging words of
him that led in the front, they made a pretty good
shift to wag along.</p>

<p>The way also was here very wearisome through
dirt and slabbiness. Nor was there on all this
ground so much as one inn or victualling-house,
therein to refresh the feebler sort. Here, therefore,
was grunting, and puffing and sighing.
While one tumbleth over a brush, another sticks
fast in the dirt; and the children, some of them,
lost their shoes in the mire. While one cries out,
"I am down!" and another, "Ho! where are you?"
and a third, "The bushes have got such fast hold
on me, I think I cannot get away from them."</p>

<p>Then they came at an arbor, warm, and promising
much refreshing to the pilgrims; for it was
finely wrought above head, beautified with greens,
furnished with benches and settles. It also had
in it a soft couch, whereon the weary might lean.
This, you must think, all things considered, was
tempting; for the pilgrims already began to be
foiled with the badness of the way; but there was
not one of them that made so much as a motion to
stop there. Yea, for aught I could perceive, they
continually gave so good heed to the advice of
their guide, and he did so faithfully tell them of
dangers, and of the nature of dangers when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
were at them, that usually, when they were
nearest to them, they did most pluck up their
spirits, and hearten one another to deny the flesh.
This arbor was called "The Slothful's Friend," on
purpose to allure, if it might be, some of the pilgrims
there to take up their rest when weary.</p>

<p>I saw then in my dream, that they went on in
this their solitary ground, till they came to a place
at which a man is apt to lose his way. Now,
though when it was light their guide could well
enough tell how to miss those ways that led wrong,
yet, in the dark, he was put to a stand. But he
had in his pocket a map of all ways leading to or
from the Celestial City; wherefore he struck a
light (for he also never goes without his tinder-box),
and takes a view of his book or map, which
bids him be careful in that place to turn to the
right-hand way. And had he not here been careful
to look in his map, they had, in all probability
been smothered in the mud; for, just a little before
them, and that at the end of the cleanest way too,
was a pit, none knows how deep, full of nothing
but mud, there made on purpose to destroy the
pilgrims in.</p>

<p>Then thought I with myself, "Who that goeth
on pilgrimage but would have one of those maps
about him, that he may look, when he is at a
stand, which is the way he must take?"</p>

<p>They went on then in this Enchanted Ground
till they came to where was another arbor, and it
was built by the highway-side. And in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
arbor there lay two men, whose names were Heedless
and Too-bold. These two went thus far on
pilgrimage; but here, being wearied with their
journey, they sat down to rest themselves, and so
fell fast asleep. When the pilgrims saw them,
they stood still, and shook their heads; for they
knew that the sleepers were in a pitiful case.
Then they consulted what to do,&mdash;whether to go
on, and leave them in their sleep, or to step to
them, and try to awake them. So they concluded
to go to them and wake them; that is, if they
could; but with this caution, namely, to take
heed that themselves did not sit down nor embrace
the offered benefit of that arbor.</p>

<p>So they went in and spake to the men, and
called each one by his name (for the guide, it
seems, did know them); but there was no voice
or answer. Then the guide did shake them, and
do what he could to disturb them. Then said one
of them, "I will pay you when I take my money."
At which the guide shook his head. "I will fight
so long as I can hold my sword in my hand," said
the other. At that, one of the children laughed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LAND OF BEULAH</div>

<p>Then said Christiana, "What is the meaning of
this?" The guide said, "They talk in their sleep.
If you strike them, beat them, or whatever else
you do to them, they will answer you after this
fashion; or, as one of them said in old time, when
the waves of the sea did beat upon him, and he
slept as one upon the mast of a ship, 'When shall
I awake? I will seek it yet again.' You know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
when men talk in their sleep, they say anything,
but their words are not governed either by faith or
reason. There is an unsuitableness in their words
now, as there was before betwixt their going on
pilgrimage and sitting down there. This, then, is
the mischief of it: when heedless ones go on pilgrimage,
'tis twenty to one but they are served
thus. For this Enchanted Ground is one of the
last refuges that the enemy to pilgrims has; wherefore,
it is, as you see, placed almost at the end of
the way, and so it standeth against us with the
more advantage. For when, thinks the enemy,
will these fools be so desirous to sit down as when
they are weary? and when so like to be weary as
when almost at their journey's end? Therefore
it is, I say, that the Enchanted Ground is placed
so near to the Land of Beulah, and so near the
end of their race. Wherefore, let pilgrims look
to themselves, lest it happen to them as it has
done to these, that, as you see, are fallen asleep,
and none can wake them."</p>

<p>Then the pilgrims desired, with trembling, to
go forward; only they prayed their guide to strike
a light, that they might go the rest of their way
by the help of the light of a lantern. So he struck
a light, and they went by the help of that through
the rest of this way, though the darkness was very
great. But the children began to be sorely weary;
and they cried out to Him that loveth pilgrims to
make their way more comfortable. So, by that
they had gone a little farther, a wind arose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
drove away the fog; so the air became more clear.
Yet they were not off, by much, of the Enchanted
Ground; only now they could see one another
better, and the way wherein they should walk.</p>

<p>Now, when they were almost at the end of this
ground, they perceived that a little before them
was a solemn noise, as of one that was much concerned.
So they went on, and looked before
them; and behold, they saw, as they thought, a
man upon his knees, with hands and eyes lift up,
and speaking, as they thought, earnestly to One
that was above. They drew nigh, but could not
tell what he said; so they went softly till he had
done. When he had done, he got up, and began
to run towards the Celestial City.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Great-heart called after him, saying,
"So-ho, friend! let us have your company, if you
go, as I suppose you do, to the Celestial City."</p>

<p>So the man stopped, and they came up to him.
But, as soon as Mr. Honest saw him, he said, "I
know this man."</p>

<p>Then said Mr. Valiant-for-truth, "Prithee, who
is it?"</p>

<p>"It is one," said he, "that comes from whereabout
I dwelt. His name is Stand-fast; he is
certainly a right good pilgrim."</p>

<p>So they came up one to another. And presently
Stand-fast said to old Honest, "Ho, father Honest,
are you there?"</p>

<p>"Ay," said he, "that I am, as sure as you are
there."</p>

<div class="sidenote">HEEDLESS AND TOO-BOLD</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>"Right glad am I," said Mr. Stand-fast, "that I
have found you on this road."</p>

<p>"And as glad am I," said the other, "that I
espied you upon your knees."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Stand-fast blushed, and said, "But
why? did you see me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that I did," quoth the other, "and with
my heart was glad at the sight."</p>

<p>"Why, what did you think?" said Stand-fast.</p>

<p>"Think!" said old Honest; "what should I
think? I thought we had an honest man upon
the road, and therefore should have his company
by-and-by."</p>

<p>"If you thought not amiss," said Stand-fast,
"how happy am I! But, if I be not as I should,
I alone must bear it."</p>

<p>"That is true," said the other; "but your fear
doth further show me that things are right betwixt
the Prince of pilgrims and your soul; for He saith,
'Blessed is the man that feareth always.'"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valiant.</span> Well, but, brother, I pray thee, tell
us what was it that was the cause of thy being
upon thy knees even now: was it for that some
special mercy laid upon thee, the need of prayer,
or how?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stand.</span> Why, we are, as you see, upon the
Enchanted Ground; and as I was coming along,
I was musing with myself of what a dangerous
road the road in this place was, and how many that
had come even thus far on pilgrimage, had here
been stopped and been destroyed. I thought also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
of the manner of the death with which this place
destroyeth men. Those that die here die of no
violent, painful disease: the death which such die
is not grievous to them. For he that goeth away
in such a sleep, begins that journey with desire
and pleasure. Yea, such sink into the will of that
disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Then Mr. Honest, interrupting of him,
said, "Did you see the two men asleep in the
arbor?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">STAND-FAST REPULSES MADAM</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Stand.</span> Ay, ay, I saw Heedless and Too-bold
there; and, for aught I know, there they will lie
till they rot. But let me go on in my tale. As I
was thus musing, as I said, there was one in very
pleasant attire, but old, who presented herself to
me, and offered me three things; to wit, her body,
her purse, and her bed. Now, the truth is, I was
both aweary and sleepy; I am also as poor as an
owlet, and that, perhaps, the witch knew. Well,
I repulsed her once or twice; but she put by my
repulses, and smiled. Then I began to be angry;
but she mattered that nothing at all. Then she
made offers again, and said, if I would be ruled by
her, she would make me great and happy. "For,"
said she, "I am the mistress of the world, and men
are made happy by me." Then I asked her name,
and she told me it was Madam Bubble. This set
me farther from her; but she still followed me
with enticements. Then I betook me, as you
saw, to my knees; and, with hands lift up, and
cries, I prayed to Him that had said He would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
help. So, just as you came up, the gentlewoman
went her way. Then I continued to give thanks
for this my great deliverance; for I verily believe
she intended no good, but rather sought to make
stop of me in my journey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Without doubt her designs were bad.
But stay: now you talk of her, methinks I either
have seen her, or have read some story of her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stand.</span> Perhaps you have done both.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Madam Bubble? Is she not a tall,
comely dame, somewhat of a swarthy complexion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stand.</span> Right, you hit it: she is just such a
one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Does she not speak very smoothly, and
give you a smile at the end of a sentence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stand.</span> You fall right upon it again, for these
are her very actions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Doth she not wear a great purse by her
side, and is not her hand often in it, fingering her
money, as if that was her heart's delight?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stand.</span> 'Tis just so. Had she stood by all this
while, you could not more amply have set her
forth before me, nor have better described her
features.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon.</span> Then he that drew her picture was a
good artist, and he that wrote of her said true.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MADAM BUBBLE'S INFLUENCE</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> This woman is a witch, and it is by
virtue of her witchcraft that this ground is enchanted.
Whoever doth lay his head down in her
lap, had as good lay it down upon that block over
which the axe doth hang; and whoever lay their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
eyes upon her beauty, are accounted the enemies
of God. This is she that maintaineth in their
splendor all those that are the enemies of pilgrims.
Yea, this is she that hath bought off many a man
from a pilgrim's life. She is a great gossiper: she
is always, both she and her daughters, at one pilgrim's
heels or other; now commanding, and then
preferring the excellences of this life. She is a
bold and impudent creature; she will talk with
any man. She always laugheth poor pilgrims to
scorn, but highly commends the rich. If there be
one cunning to get money in a place, she will
speak well of him from house to house. She
loveth banqueting and feasting mainly well; she
is always at one full table or another. She has
given it out in some places that she is a goddess,
and therefore some do worship her. She has her
times and open places of cheating; and she will
say and avow it, that none can show a good comparable
to hers. She promiseth to dwell with
children's children, if they will but love her and
make much of her. She will cast out of her purse
gold like dust, in some places and to some persons.
She loves to be sought after, spoken well of, and
to lie in the bosoms of men. She is never weary
of praising her gifts and she loves them most that
think best of her. She will promise, to some,
crowns and kingdoms, if they will but take her
advice; yet many hath she brought to the halter,
and ten thousand times more to hell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stand.</span> "Oh," said Mr. Stand-fast, "what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
mercy it is that I did resist her! for whither might
she have drawn me?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great.</span> Whither! nay, none but God knows
whither; but in general, to be sure, she would have
drawn thee into many foolish and hurtful lusts,
which drown men in destruction and ruin. 'Twas
she that set Absalom against his father, and Jeroboam
against his master. 'Twas she that persuaded
Judas to sell his Lord, and that prevailed
with Demas to forsake the godly pilgrim's life.
None can tell of the mischief that she doth. She
makes variance betwixt rulers and subjects,
betwixt parents and children, betwixt neighbor
and neighbor, betwixt a man and his wife, betwixt
a man and himself, betwixt the flesh and the heart.
Wherefore, good Master Stand-fast, be as your
name is, and when you have done all, stand.</p>

<p>At this course there was among the pilgrims
a mixture of joy and trembling; but at length they
brake out, and sang:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>THE PILGRIMS AT HOME.</h3>


<p>After this, I beheld until they were come
unto the Land of Beulah, where the sun
shineth night and day. Here, because
they were weary, they betook themselves
awhile to rest. And because this country
was common for pilgrims, and because the
orchards and vineyards that were here belong
to the King of the Celestial Country, therefore they
were permitted to make bold with any of His
things. But a little while soon refreshed them
here; for the bells did so ring, and the trumpets
continually sound so melodiously, that they could
not sleep and yet they received as much refreshing
as if they had slept their sleep never so soundly.
Here also the noise of them that walked in the
streets was, "More pilgrims are come to town!"
And another would answer, saying, "And so many
went over the water, and were let in at the golden
gates, to-day!" They would cry again, "There is
now a legion of Shining Ones just come to town, by
which we know that there are more pilgrims upon
the road; for here they come to wait for them,
and comfort them after all their sorrow!" Then
the pilgrims got up, and walked to and fro. But
how were their ears now filled with heavenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
voices, and their eyes delighted with celestial
visions! In this land they heard nothing, saw
nothing, felt nothing, smelt nothing, tasted nothing,
that was offensive to their stomach or mind;
only when they tasted of the water of the river
over which they were to go, they thought that it
tasted a little bitterish to the palate, but it proved
sweeter when it was down.</p>

<p>In this place there was a record kept of the
names of them that had been pilgrims of old, and
a history of all the famous acts that they had done.
It was here also much spoken of, how the river to
some had had its flowings, and what ebbings it
had had while others have gone over. It has been
in a manner dry for some, while it has overflowed
its banks for others.</p>

<p>In this place, the children of the town would go
into the King's gardens, and gather nosegays for
the pilgrims, and bring them to them with much
affection. Here also grew camphire, with spikenard,
and saffron, calamus, and cinnamon, with
all the trees of frankincense, myrrh, and aloes,
with all chief spices. With these the pilgrims'
chambers were perfumed while they stayed here;
and with these were their bodies anointed, to prepare
them to go over the river, when the time
appointed was come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTIANA RECEIVES MESSAGE</div>

<p>Now, while they lay here, and waited for the
good hour, there was a noise in the town that there
was a messenger come from the Celestial City with
matter of great importance to one Christiana, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
wife of Christian the pilgrim. So inquiry was
made for her, and the house was found out where
she was. So the messenger presented her with a
letter; the contents whereof were, "Hail, good
woman! I bring thee tidings that the Master
calleth for thee, and expecteth that thou shouldest
stand in His presence, in clothes of everlasting
life, within these ten days."</p>

<p>When he had read this letter to her, he gave her
therewith a sure token that he was a true messenger,
and was come to bid her make haste to be
gone. The token was an arrow, with a point
sharpened with love, let easily into her heart,
which by degrees wrought so effectually with her,
that at the time appointed she must be gone.</p>

<p>When Christiana saw that her time was come,
and that she was the first of this company that
was to go over, she called for Mr. Great-heart,
her guide, and told him how matters were. So he
told her he was heartily glad of the news, and
could have been glad had the post come for him.
Then she bid that he should give advice how all
things should be prepared for her journey. So he
told her, saying, "Thus and thus it must be; and
we that are left will accompany you to the river-side."</p>

<p>Then she called for her children, and gave them
her blessing, and told them that she yet read with
comfort the mark that was set in their foreheads,
and was glad to see them with her there, and that
they had kept their garments so white. Lastly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
she gave to the poor that little she had, and commanded
her sons and her daughters to be ready
against the messenger should come for them.</p>

<p>When she had spoken these words to her guide
and to her children, she called for Mr. Valiant-for-truth,
and said unto him, "Sir, you have in all
places shown yourself true-hearted. Be faithful
unto death, and my King will give you a crown
of life. I would also entreat you to have an eye
to my children; and if at any time you see them
faint, speak comfortably to them. For my
daughters, my sons' wives, they have been faithful;
and a fulfilling of the promise upon them will
be their end." But she gave Mr. Stand-fast a
ring.</p>

<p>Then she called for old Mr. Honest, and said of
him, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no
guile."</p>

<p>Then said he, "I wish you a fair day when you
set out for Mount Zion, and shall be glad to see
that you go over the river dry shod."</p>

<p>But she answered, "Come wet, come dry, I long
to be gone; for, however the weather is in my
journey, I shall have time enough when I come
there to sit down and rest me and dry me."</p>

<p>Then came in that good man, Mr. Ready-to-halt,
to see her. So she said to him, "Thy travel
hitherto has been with difficulty; but that will
make thy rest the sweeter. But watch and be
ready; for, at an hour when you think not, the
messenger may come."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>After him came in Mr. Despondency and his
daughter Much-afraid; to whom she said, "You
ought with thankfulness for ever to remember
your deliverance from the hands of Giant Despair
and out of Doubting Castle. The effect of that
mercy is that you are brought with safety hither.
Be ye watchful, and cast away fear; be sober, and
hope to the end."</p>

<p>Then she said to Mr. Feeble-mind, "Thou wast
delivered from the mouth of Giant Slay-good, that
thou mightest live in the light of the living for
ever, and see thy King with comfort. Only I
advise thee to turn thee of thy aptness to fear and
doubt of His goodness, before He sends for thee;
lest thou shouldest, when He comes, be forced to
stand before Him for that fault with blushing."</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTIANA CROSSES THE RIVER</div>

<p>Now, the day drew on that Christiana must be
gone. So the road was full of people to see her
take her journey. But, behold, all the banks
beyond the river were full of horses and chariots,
which were come down from above to accompany
her to the City gate. So she came forth and
entered the river, with a beckon of farewell to
those that followed her to the river-side. The
last words that she was heard to say were, "I
come, Lord, to be with Thee, and bless Thee!"</p>

<p>So her children and friends returned to their
place, for that those that waited for Christiana
had carried her out of their sight. So she went
and called, and entered in at the gate with all the
tokens of joy that her husband Christian had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
done before her. At her departure her children
wept. But Mr. Great-heart and Mr. Valiant
played upon the well-tuned cymbal and harp for
joy. So all departed to their respective places.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PILGRIMS RECEIVE MESSAGES</div>

<p>In process of time, there came a messenger to
the town again, and his business was with Mr.
Ready-to-halt. So he inquired him out, and said
to him, "I am come to thee from Him whom thou
hast loved and followed, though upon crutches;
and my message is to tell thee, that He expects
thee at His table, to sup with Him in His kingdom,
the next day after Easter; wherefore prepare thyself
for this journey." Then he also gave him a
token that he was a true messenger, saying, "I
have broken thy golden bowl and loosed thy
silver cord."</p>

<p>After this Mr. Ready-to-halt called for his
fellow-pilgrims, and told them, saying, "I am sent
for, and God shall surely visit you also." So he
desired Mr. Valiant to make his will. And because
he had nothing to bequeath to them that
should survive him but his crutches and his good
wishes, therefore thus he said: "These crutches I
bequeath to my son that shall tread in my steps,
with a hundred warm wishes that he may prove
better than I have done." Then he thanked Mr.
Great-heart for his conduct and kindness, and so
addressed himself to his journey. When he came
to the brink of the river, he said, "Now I shall
have no more need of these crutches, since yonder
are chariots and horses for me to ride on." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
last words he was heard to say were, "Welcome
life!" So he went his way.</p>

<p>After this, Mr. Feeble-mind had tidings brought
him, that the messenger sounded his horn at his
chamber-door. Then he came in, and told him,
saying, "I am come to tell thee that thy Master
has need of thee, and that in a very little time thou
must behold His face in brightness. And take this
as a token of the truth of my message: 'Those that
look out at the windows shall be darkened.'"
Then Mr. Feeble-mind called for his friends, and
told them what errand had been brought unto
him, and what token he had received of the truth
of the message. Then he said, "Since I have
nothing to bequeath to any, to what purpose
should I make a will? As for my feeble mind,
that I will leave behind me, for that I shall have
no need of in the place whither I go, nor is it worth
bestowing upon the poorest pilgrim: wherefore,
when I am gone, I desire that you, Mr. Valiant,
would bury it in a dunghill." This done, and the
day being come on which he was to depart, he
entered the river as the rest. His last words were,
"Hold out, faith and patience!" So he went over
to the other side.</p>

<p>When days had many of them passed away, Mr.
Despondency was sent for; for a messenger was
come, and brought this message to him: "Trembling
man, these are to summon thee to be ready
with thy King by the next Lord's day, to shout
for joy for thy deliverance from all thy doubtings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
And," said the messenger, "that my message is
true, take this for a proof." So he gave him the
grasshopper to be a burden unto him.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Despondency's daughter, whose name
was Much-afraid, said when she heard what was
done, that she would go with her father. Then
Mr. Despondency said to his friends, "Myself and
my daughter, you know what we have been, and
how troublesomely we have behaved ourselves in
every company. My will and my daughter's is,
that our discouraged feelings and slavish fears be
by no man received, from the day of our departure
for ever; for I know that after my death they will
offer themselves to others. For, to be plain with
you, they are ghosts the which we entertained
when we first began to be pilgrims, and could
never shake them off after; and they will walk
about and seek entertainment of the pilgrims;
but, for our sakes, shut ye the doors upon them."
When the time was come for them to depart, they
went to the brink of the river. The last words
of Mr. Despondency were, "Farewell, night! welcome,
day!" His daughter went through the
river singing, but none could understand what
she said.</p>

<p>Then it came to pass a while after, that there
was a messenger in the town that inquired for Mr.
Honest. So he came to his house where he was,
and delivered to his hand these lines: "Thou art
commanded to be ready against this day seven-night,
to present thyself before thy Lord at His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
Father's house. And for a token that my message
is true, 'All thy daughters of music shall be brought
low.'" Then Mr. Honest called for his friends,
and said unto them, "I die, but shall make no will.
As for my honesty, it shall go with me: let them
that come after me be told this." When the day
that he was to be gone was come, he prepared
himself to go over the river. Now, the river at
that time overflowed its banks in some places;
but Mr. Honest in his lifetime had spoken to one
Good-conscience to meet him there; the which also
he did, and lent him his hand, and so helped him
over. The last words of Mr. Honest were, "Grace
reigns!" So he left the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FINAL SUMMONS</div>

<p>After this, it was noised abroad that Mr. Valiant-for-truth
was taken with a summons by the same
messenger as the other, and had this for a token
that the summons was true, that his pitcher was
broken at the fountain. When he understood it,
he called for his friends, and told them of it. Then
said he, "I am going to my Father's; and though
with great difficulty I am got hither, yet now I do
not repent me of all the trouble I have been at to
arrive where I am. My sword I give to him that
shall succeed me in my pilgrimage, and my courage
and skill to him that can get it. My marks
and scars I carry with me, to be a witness for me
that I have fought His battles who now will be
my rewarder." When the day that he must go
hence was come, many accompanied him to the
river-side, into which as he went he said, "Death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
where is thy sting?" And, as he went down
deeper, he said, "Grave, where is thy victory?"
So he passed over, and all the trumpets sounded
for him on the other side.</p>

<p>Then there came forth a summons for Mr.
Stand-fast (this Mr. Stand-fast was he whom the
pilgrims found upon his knees in the Enchanted
Ground), for the messenger brought it him open
in his hands; the contents thereof were, that he
must prepare for a change of life, for his Master
was not willing that he should be so far from Him
any longer. At this Mr. Stand-fast was put into
a muse.</p>

<p>"Nay," said the messenger, "you need not doubt
the truth of my message, for here is a token of the
truth thereof: 'Thy wheel is broken at the cistern.'"</p>

<p>Then he called to him Mr. Great-heart, who was
their guide, and said unto him, "Sir, although it
was not my hap to be much in your good company
in the days of my pilgrimage, yet, since the time I
knew you, you have been profitable to me. When
I came from home, I left behind me a wife and five
small children: let me entreat you at your return
(for I know that you will go and return to your
master's house, in hopes that you may yet be a
conductor to more of the holy pilgrims), that you
send to my family, and let them be acquainted
with all that hath or shall happen unto me. Tell
them moreover of my happy arrival to this place,
and of the present and late blessed condition that
I am in. Tell them also of Christian and Christiana<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
his wife, and how she and her children came
after her husband. Tell them also what a happy
end she made, and whither she is gone. I have
little or nothing to send to my family, unless it be
my prayers and tears for them; of which it will
suffice that you acquaint them, if peradventure
they may prevail."</p>

<div class="sidenote">END OF THE PILGRIMAGE</div>

<p>When Mr. Stand-fast had thus set things in
order, and the time being come for him to haste
him away, he also went down to the river. Now,
there was a great calm at that time in the river;
wherefore Mr. Stand-fast, when he was about
half-way in, stood a while, and talked to his companions
that had waited upon him thither. And
he said, "This river has been a terror to many;
yea, the thoughts of it have also frighted me; but
now methinks I stand easy; my foot is fixed upon
that on which the feet of the priests that bare the
ark of the covenant stood while Israel went over
Jordan. The waters, indeed, are to the palate
bitter, and to the stomach cold; yet the thought
of what I am going to, and of the conduct that
waits for me on the other side, doth lie as a glowing
coal at my heart. I see myself now at the end of
my journey; my toilsome days are ended. I am
going to see that head which was crowned with
thorns, and that face which was spit upon for me.
I have formerly lived by hearsay and faith; but
now I go where I shall live by sight, and shall be
with Him in whose company I delight myself.
I have loved to hear my Lord spoken of; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
wherever I have seen the print of His shoe in the
earth, there I have coveted to set my foot too.
His name has been to me as a perfume box; yea,
sweeter than all sweet smells. His voice to me
has been most sweet, and His countenance I have
more desired than they that have most desired the
light of the sun. His Word I did use to gather
for my food, and for medicine against my faintings.
He has held me, and hath kept me from my sins;
yea, my steps hath He strengthened in His way."</p>

<p>Now, while he was thus speaking, his countenance
changed, his strong man bowed under him;
and, after he had said, "Take me, for I come unto
Thee!" he ceased to be seen of them.</p>

<p>But glorious it was to see how the open region
was filled with horses and chariots, with trumpeters
and pipers, with singers and players on
stringed instruments to welcome the pilgrims as
they went up, and followed one another in at the
beautiful gate of the City.</p>

<p>As for Christian's children, the four boys that
Christiana brought with her, with their wives and
children, I did not stay where I was till they were
gone over. Also, since I came away, I heard one
say that they were yet alive, and so would be for
the help of the Church in that place where they
were for a time.</p>

<p>Shall it be my lot to go that way again, I may
give those that desire it an account of what I here
am silent about: meantime I bid my reader</p>

<span class="i0">And play in the garden all the day,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Quite happy and content."</span><br />
<span class="i0">A few more parting words were said,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And off the ladies went.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The servants, too, were all engaged;</span><br />
<span class="i1">"The day is come at last,"</span><br />
<span class="i0">Said Marian, "but oh, I wish,</span><br />
<span class="i1">My pilgrimage was past."</span><br />
<span class="i0">She knelt beside the apple-tree,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And for God's assistance prayed;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then, with her basket in her hand,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Forth tripped the little maid.</span>
</div>


<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Behind the house where Marian dwelt,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Far off in the distance, lay</span><br />
<span class="i0">A high steep hill, which the sun at morn</span><br />
<span class="i1">Tinged with its earliest ray.</span><br />
<span class="i0">"Difficulty" was its rightful name,</span><br />
<span class="i1">The child had often thought;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Towards this hill she turned her steps,</span><br />
<span class="i1">With hopeful visions fraught.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The flowers seemed to welcome her,</span><br />
<span class="i1">'Twas a lovely autumn morn,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The little lark sang merrily,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Above the waving corn.</span><br />
<span class="i0">"Ah, little lark, you sing," said she,</span><br />
<span class="i1">"On your early pilgrimage;</span><br />
<span class="i0">I, too, will sing, for pleasant thoughts</span><br />
<span class="i1">Should now my mind engage."</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In clear, sweet strains she sang a hymn,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And tripped lightly on her way;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Until a pool of soft, thick mud</span><br />
<span class="i1">Across her pathway lay.</span><br />
<span class="i0">"This is the Slough of Despond," she cried,</span><br />
<span class="i1">But she bravely ventured through;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And safely reached the other side,</span><br />
<span class="i1">But she lost one little shoe.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On an old gray stone she sat her down,</span><br />
<span class="i1">To eat some fruit and bread;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then took her little Bible out,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And a cheering psalm she read.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then with fresh hope she journeyed on,</span><br />
<span class="i1">For many miles away;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And she reached the bottom of the hill,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Before the close of day.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She clambered up the steep ascent,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Though faint and weary, too;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But firmly did our Marian keep</span><br />
<span class="i1">Her purpose still in view.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I'm glad, at least, the arbor's past,"</span><br />
<span class="i1">Said the little tired soul;</span><br />
<span class="i0">"I'm sure I should have sat me down</span><br />
<span class="i1">And lost my little roll!"</span><br />
<span class="i0">On the high hill-top she stands at last,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And our weary Pilgrim sees</span><br />
<span class="i0">A porter's lodge, of ample size,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Half hid by sheltering trees.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She clapped her hands with joy, and cried,</span><br />
<span class="i1">"Oh, there's the Wicket Gate,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And I must seek admittance there,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Before it is too late."</span><br />
<span class="i0">Gently she knocks&mdash;'tis answered soon,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And at the open door</span><br />
<span class="i0">Stands a tall, stout man&mdash;poor Marian felt</span><br />
<span class="i1">As she ne'er had felt before.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With tearful eyes, and trembling hand,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Flushed cheek, and anxious brow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">She said, "I hope you're Watchful, Sir,</span><br />
<span class="i1">I want Discretion now."</span>

</div>

<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh yes, I'm watchful," said the man,</span><br />
<span class="i1">"As a porter ought to be;</span><br />
<span class="i0">I s'pose you've lost your way, young Miss,</span><br />
<span class="i1">You've lost your shoe, I see.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Missus," he cried to his wife within,</span><br />
<span class="i1">"Here's a child here, at the door,</span><br />
<span class="i0">You'll never see such a one again,</span><br />
<span class="i1">If you live to be fourscore.</span><br />
<span class="i0">She wants discretion, so she says,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Indeed I think 'tis true;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But I know some who want it more,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Who will not own they do."</span>
</div>


<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Go to the Hall," his wife replies,</span><br />
<span class="i1">"And take the child with you,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The ladies there are all so wise,</span><br />
<span class="i1">They'll soon know what to do."</span><br />
<span class="i0">The man complied, and led the child</span><br />
<span class="i1">Through many a flowery glade;</span><br />
<span class="i0">"Is that the Palace Beautiful?"</span><br />
<span class="i1">The little Pilgrim said.</span>
</div>


<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There, to the left, among the trees?</span><br />
<span class="i1">Why, Miss, 'tis mighty grand;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Call it a palace, if you please,</span><br />
<span class="i1">'Tis the finest in the land.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now we be come to the fine old porch,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And this is the Marble Hall;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Here, little lady, you must stay,</span><br />
<span class="i1">While I the servants call."</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Tired and sad he left the child,</span><br />
<span class="i1">But he quickly re-appeared,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And with him the lady of the house&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i1">Poor Marian's heart was cheered.</span><br />
<span class="i0">"Sweet little girl," the lady said,</span><br />
<span class="i1">In accents soft and kind,</span><br />
<span class="i0">"I'm sure you sadly want some rest,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And rest you soon shall find."</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To a room where three young ladies sat,</span><br />
<span class="i1">The child was quickly led;</span><br />
<span class="i0">"Piety, Prudence, and Charity,"</span><br />
<span class="i1">To herself she softly said.</span><br />
<span class="i0">"What is your name, my little dear?"</span><br />
<span class="i1">Said the eldest of the three,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whom Marian, in her secret thought,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Had christened Piety.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We'll send a servant to your friends,</span><br />
<span class="i1">How uneasy they must be!"</span><br />
<span class="i0">Admiringly she watched the child,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Who, indeed, was fair to see;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Around her bright and lovely face</span><br />
<span class="i1">Fell waves of auburn hair,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As modestly she told her name,</span><br />
<span class="i1">With whom she lived and where.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How did you lose your way, my love?"</span><br />
<span class="i1">She gently raised her head;</span><br />
<span class="i0">"I do not think I've lost my way,"</span><br />
<span class="i1">The little Pilgrim said.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"This is the Palace Beautiful,</span><br />
<span class="i1">May I stay here to-night?"</span><br />
<span class="i0">They smiled and said, "We're glad our house</span><br />
<span class="i1">Finds favor in your sight:&mdash;</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yes, gladly will we keep you here,</span><br />
<span class="i1">For many nights to come."</span><br />
<span class="i0">"Thank you," said Marian, "but I soon</span><br />
<span class="i1">Must seek my heavenly home.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Valley of the Shadow of Death</span><br />
<span class="i1">Is near this house, I know"&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">She stopped, for she saw, with great surprise,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Their tears began to flow.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She little thought the mourning dress,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Which all the ladies wore,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Was for one whom they had dearly loved,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And should see on earth no more.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Their brother had been called away,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Their brightest and their best;</span><br />
<span class="i0">No wonder, then, that Marian's words</span><br />
<span class="i1">Roused grief in every breast.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sobs only for awhile were heard;</span><br />
<span class="i1">At length the ladies said,</span><br />
<span class="i0">"My, love, you have reminded us</span><br />
<span class="i1">Of our loved and early dead;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But this you could not know, my dear,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And it indeed is true;</span><br />
<span class="i0">We are all near to Death's dark door,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Even little girls like you."</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Yes," said the timid, trembling child,</span><br />
<span class="i1">"I know it must be so;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But, ma'am, I hope that Piety</span><br />
<span class="i1">May be with me when I go.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And will you show me your armory,</span><br />
<span class="i1">When you have time to spare?</span><br />
<span class="i0">I hope you have some small enough</span><br />
<span class="i1">For a little girl to wear."</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No more she said, for Piety,</span><br />
<span class="i1">As Marian called her, cast</span><br />
<span class="i0">Her arms around the Pilgrim's neck,</span><br />
<span class="i1">The secret's out at last.</span><br />
<span class="i0">"You puzzled all," said Piety;</span><br />
<span class="i1">"But now, I see, you've read</span><br />
<span class="i0">A glorious book, which, unexplained,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Has turned your little head.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, dearly, when I was a child,</span><br />
<span class="i1">I loved that Pilgrim Tale;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But then mamma explained it well&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i1">And if we can prevail</span><br />
<span class="i0">On your kind aunts to let you stay</span><br />
<span class="i1">Some time with us, my dear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">You shall read that book with my mamma,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And she will make it clear."</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now we'll return to Marian's home,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And see what's passing there.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The servants all had company,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And a merry group they were.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
<span class="i0">They had not missed our Pilgrim long,</span><br />
<span class="i1">For they knew she oft would play</span><br />
<span class="i0">In that old garden, with a book,</span><br />
<span class="i1">The whole of the livelong day.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Betty," at last, said the housekeeper,</span><br />
<span class="i1">"Where can Miss Marian be?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Her dinner was in the basket packed,</span><br />
<span class="i1">But sure, she'll come in to tea!"</span><br />
<span class="i0">They sought her here, they sought her there,</span><br />
<span class="i1">But they could not find the child;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And her poor old aunts, when they came home,</span><br />
<span class="i1">With grief were almost wild.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The coachman and the footman too,</span><br />
<span class="i1">In different ways were sent;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But none thought of the narrow way</span><br />
<span class="i1">In which the Pilgrim went.</span><br />
<span class="i0">"Perhaps she followed us to town,"</span><br />
<span class="i1">Poor Aunt Rebecca said,</span><br />
<span class="i0">"I wish we had not left our home;</span><br />
<span class="i1">I fear the child is dead."</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And to the town the coachman went,</span><br />
<span class="i1">For they knew not what to do;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And night drew on, when a country boy</span><br />
<span class="i1">Brought Marian's little shoe.</span><br />
<span class="i0">With the shoe in her hand, the housekeeper</span><br />
<span class="i1">Into the parlor ran,</span><br />
<span class="i0">"Oh, Mistress, here is all that's left</span><br />
<span class="i1">Of poor Miss Marian.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"It was found sticking in the mud,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Just above Harlem Chase;</span><br />
<span class="i0">I fear the poor child's perished there,</span><br />
<span class="i1">For 'tis a frightful place."</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then louder grew the ladies' grief;</span><br />
<span class="i1">But soon their hearts were cheered,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When a footman grand, with a note in his hand,</span><br />
<span class="i1">From the distant Hall appeared.</span></div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Aunt Ruth now read the note, and cried,</span><br />
<span class="i1">"Oh, sister, all is well!</span><br />
<span class="i0">The child is safe at Brookland Hall,</span><br />
<span class="i1">With Lady Arundel,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who wants to keep her for a month;</span><br />
<span class="i1">Why, yes; I think she may&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Such friends as Lady Arundel</span><br />
<span class="i1">Are not met with every day.</span></div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Our compliments, and thanks to her,</span><br />
<span class="i1">When you return, young man;</span><br />
<span class="i0">We'll call to-morrow at the Hall,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And see Miss Marian."</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then came a burst of grateful joy,</span><br />
<span class="i1">That could not be suppressed,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, with thankful hearts and many tears,</span><br />
<span class="i1">The ladies went to rest.</span></div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We'll take a peep at our Marian now,</span><br />
<span class="i1">There in her bed lies she;</span><br />
<span class="i0">How blissful were her dreams that night,</span><br />
<span class="i1">In the arms of Piety.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, that happy month at Brookland Hall,</span><br />
<span class="i1">How soon it passed away!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Cheerful and good were Marian's friends,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And who so kind as they?</span>
</div>


<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And, more than all, while there she stayed</span><br />
<span class="i1">They did their best to bring</span><br />
<span class="i0">The little lamb to that blest fold</span><br />
<span class="i1">Where reigns the Shepherd King.</span><br />
<span class="i0">For many a lesson ne'er forgot,</span><br />
<span class="i1">The little Marian learned;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And a thoughtful and a happier child</span><br />
<span class="i1">She to her home returned.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Years rolled away, the scene has changed,</span><br />
<span class="i1">A wife and mother now,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Marian has found the Wicket Gate,</span><br />
<span class="i1">She and her children too.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And oh! how sweet it is to see</span><br />
<span class="i1">This little Pilgrim band,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As on towards their heavenly home,</span><br />
<span class="i1">They travel hand in hand.</span><br />
<span class="i0">When cloudy days fall to their lot,</span><br />
<span class="i1">They see a light afar,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The light that shone on Bethlehem's plain,</span><br />
<span class="i1">The Pilgrim's guiding star.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now, dear children, whosoe'er,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Or whereso'er you be,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who ponder o'er this strange, true tale</span><br />
<span class="i1">Of Marian's history,&mdash;</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
<span class="i0">If to the Flowers of your young hearts,</span><br />

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
